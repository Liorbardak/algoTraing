        "text": "Thanks, Ashish, and welcome, everybody. Indy continues to significantly outpace our industry peer group and is capitalizing on technology deployment momentum in the auto tech market. Despite the contracting vehicle end market, we produce 29% year-over-year top-line growth to a record first quarter level, albeit slightly below our guidance. Our innovative product portfolio continues to gain design wind traction across ADAS, user experience, and electrification applications, positioning Indy to benefit from outsized growth through new program ramps in the second half of this year and over the longer-term planning horizon. In the meantime, global automotive markets are facing transitory headwinds following strong growth in 2022 and 2023. According to S&P Global, in 2022, light vehicle production was up 7% year over year and up 9% in 2023, while for 2024, production is expected to be flat to down year over year at under 90 million vehicles. This forecast reflects weaker demand stemming from persistently higher interest rates and inflationary pressures, and in turn has led to consumers opting for more economical, de-featured car models which typically carry lower semiconductor content. In particular, the EV market has been exhibiting precipitous decline in consumer demand of late. The International Energy Agency, in their 2024 Global EV Outlook, highlighted higher EV costs as one of the top consumer concerns impacting adoption in the current environment. This, coupled with reduced EV subsidies in some markets, range anxiety due to a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging infrastructure, and some regulatory relaxation in the phase-out of combustion engines, have led to OEMs prioritizing a more affordable ICE and hybrid model in the near term, which tend to contain legacy silicon versus newer feature-rich EV vehicles. This slowdown in global vehicle sales and this shift in mix towards lower silicon content vehicles, coupled with the ongoing inventory correction of our Tier 1 customers, is pressuring the addressable market in real time. Specifically, S&P Mobility recently trimmed their 2024 growth forecast for the automotive semiconductor dollar TAM to the low single digits, a notable deceleration from the 23% posted in 2023. Nevertheless, We believe much of this short-term negativity has been overblown, given the regulatory imperatives for level 2 plus active safety, which features heavy indie content and the recurring fundamental that new functionality has always transitioned from high-end models to lower tiers since the beginning of the automotive industry. Further, our strategic growth trajectory is completely independent of the adoption of electric, hybrid, or internal combustion powertrains. Harking back to Henry Ford, He once said that if he asked customers what they really wanted, they would have asked him for a faster horse. In any event, the Indy team remains intensely focused and continues to drive relentless innovation and win exciting designs across our differentiated product portfolio. The long-term automotive megatrends, including driver safety and automation, best-in-class in-cabin user experiences and drivetrain electrification, will ultimately foster demand and substantially boost addressable silicon content. In fact, a recent McKinsey report highlighted that automotive semiconductors are expected to have the fastest 10-year growth rate across all semiconductor sectors. And given our broad array of products, underlying patent portfolio, and demonstrated scalability, Indy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. To that end, we are executing to a highly differentiated sensor fusion strategy to address the growing needs for ADAS solutions, leveraging key sensing technologies such as computer vision, radar, lidar, and ultrasound. This multimodal approach creates redundancy and compensates for the limitations of individual sensors, enhancing system robustness and reliability, which is ideal for challenging driving scenarios and changing environments where precision and timely response are safety critical. We believe this holistic sensor strategy at scale ensures the highest level of driver and passenger protection, and effectively meets the diverse and increasingly complex needs of ADAS implementations across the entire spectrum of use cases, from basic driver assistance features to higher levels of vehicle automation. As automakers and consumers alike demand ever higher levels of safety and functionality, SensorFusion positions Indy to be the partner of choice in delivering these increasingly sophisticated yet cost-effective solutions. Specifically, in terms of our radar initiative, I'm pleased to report that we have successfully sampled our highly integrated radar mimic and baseband solutions and are on track to commence our program ramp next year. On the computer vision front, during the quarter, we secured a major program win that will deploy our technology at Honda for blind spot detection, using both side and rear camera feeds for unprecedented visibility and safety. This will be a multi-model deployment at Honda, with first vehicles on the road with our technology as soon as next year. Additionally, we recently captured a key camera design with Vallejo, further expanding our vision-based sensing footprint across leading Tier 1 suppliers. And leveraging our image signal processor algorithms, we enabled augmented reality navigational systems within Cadillac's 2025 Escalade models, and anticipate this breakthrough technology will cascade down throughout the GM vehicle lineup over time. Again, speaking of GM, we are thrilled to share that our next-generation vision processor has been selected for their occupant monitoring system, with deployment starting in 2026. This combined with the North American OEM OMS win that we alluded to last quarter, which I can now share is with Ford, and other leading OEMs, including BMW, position Indy to seize a first mover advantage in this rapidly emerging application. This development validates Indy's best in class technology and demonstrates our relentless focus on innovation and product roadmap execution. Further, we're preparing to sample our next generation flagship SOCs, the Indy 880 family, for automotive camera applications that will usher in unprecedented features to the automotive industry. This chip can process several cameras simultaneously at ultra-low power, reducing the system bond while addressing the unmet needs of ADAS applications. At a higher level in our discussions with leading global OEMs and tier 1s, it's becoming increasingly clear that the previous one-size-fits-all central compute architecture is fast losing mindshare. The industry needs a more distributed intelligence, zonal processing-enabled approach that can efficiently scale across vehicle segments. By doing more processing at the edge and zones and intelligently fusing and partitioning sensor data, we can dramatically reduce system cost, complexity, and power consumption. S&P Mobility sees this distributed ADAS zonal processing as a $2 billion standalone silicon opportunity by 2029, and we intend to lead it. Indy is developing a new generation of distributed processing solutions that will incorporate sensor fusion to meet underserved market needs, for cost-effective and power-efficient ADAS functionality up to the level 2 plus segment. In support of this, we recently announced a minority investment in AI processing leader Expedera. We intend to integrate custom neural networking processing IP from this exciting collaboration into our future sensor fusion solutions, allowing high-performance ADAS AI processing to be driven into mass market vehicles. Scaling ADAS from feature-rich down to entry-level vehicles is an industry fundamental. and one that INDI is firmly committed to realizing. According to the United Nations, 1.19 million people die in car crashes every year around the world. That's 3,260 people per day. It's a staggering human toll, not just for the victims, but for their surviving family members. INDI is uniquely positioned to help mitigate and ultimately prevent these tragedies via our cost-effective, innovative ADAS technologies. Turning to user experience, we continue to launch new products that enable our customers to redefine the in-cabin experience. Leading automators such as Audi are leveraging interior and exterior lighting as a core pillar of their brand identity, while consumers are demanding seamless integration and charging of their personal devices. Indy is leading the way in enabling these experiences with highly integrated solutions that set the standard for performance and efficiency. This quarter, we introduced a new family of smart connectivity solutions that enable high-speed networking of displays and controllers throughout the vehicle with best-in-class signal integrity. In fact, a leading North American e-vehicle OEM is planning to ramp this technology into their mainstream platforms in 2025. At the same time, we've achieved production readiness for our highly integrated mixed signal solution that enables advanced ultrasonic intrusion detection, leveraging piezoelectric transducers at Volkswagen. In addition, we continue to capture key design wins for our wireless charging technology. During the quarter, a major Tier 1 selected us for use across multiple vehicle models with another leading OEM targeting the booming Indian market with production slated to ramp in 2025. And more recently, I'm delighted to report that we've been awarded wireless charging design wins in support of a leading North American OEM. Our innovative solutions have been winning across multiple applications within the cabin, including with the newest flagship SU7 from Xiaomi, which includes more than 10 indie chips, serving as yet another testament to our degree of innovation. In short, we continue to demonstrate tremendous design wind momentum, setting the stage for outsized growth. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for a discussion of our Q1 results and Q2 outlook."

        "text": "Thanks, Donald. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was up 29% year-over-year to $52.4 million, though short of our guidance, as Donald outlined. Gross profit was $26.4 million, translating into a 50.3% gross margin, also below plan as a result of an unfavorable product mix. R&D was 32.6 million, while SG&A was 11 million, bringing total operating expenses to $43.6 million, slightly better than our forecast. In turn, our Q1 operating loss was $17.2 million. With net interest expense of $500,000 and excluding tax benefits, our net loss was $17.7 million, and we posted a 10-cent loss per share on a base of 186 million shares. Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we generated a $4.2 million working capital benefit, partially offset by $2.3 million in capital expenditures, primarily for expanded RF lab capability and radar production test tooling. Additionally, we've initiated an asset-backed revolver, adding $10 million at a relatively low-cost capital with zero dilution, and enabling us to exit the quarter with $148.2 million in total cash. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect Indy's revenue to be flat to up 5% sequentially, more than offsetting the current market softness stemming from the still ongoing industry-wide inventory rebalancing. At the same time, we are planning on gross margin expansion back to the 51 to 52% range from a richer product mix, sequentially flat expenses, and as a result, a narrower operating loss. Below the line, we anticipate $800,000 of net interest expense and no taxes. Assuming the midpoint of these ranges and with 191 million shares outstanding, we expect a $0.09 net loss per share in the current quarter. Looking ahead, based on the strength of our new product pipeline and a general market recovery as channel inventory levels normalize, we plan to return to high growth mode in the back half of this year, reaching EBITDA profitability by Q4 and to resume our industry-leading growth trajectory into 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back to Donald for his closing comments."

        "text": "Certainly, that's kind of a longer conversation that we can have, Suji, but yes. I mean, our differentiation has been heavily driven by the fact that our image signal processing technology is simply the best in class, and our products are very much right-sized for the exact applications that we're winning at. So we are really getting an unfair share of our wins here just because of the technology deployment that we have. In terms of central versus distributed or central versus zone controlling, what we are seeing in the market is really that there's a softening of the expectation that everything goes central because it has become simply unmanageable in many cases, and whereas maybe a couple of years ago we might have got thrown out for suggesting something like that, now, to use a phrase I often use, we're running into open doors, and we're walking in there with our concept and OEMs and tier ones alike are saying, yes, that's what we want. And we feel really, really super good about that. And that will encompass also the fusion of not only our vision products, but also our radar products and LIDAR and ultrasound as time progresses also. So, I mean, in terms of the long term, our story is entirely intact. We're driving a lot of wins and you can see from just the number of them that came out in our prepared remarks that we really have a lot of momentum and a lot of traction. So in spite of the current bumps that we're going through, let's call it an air pocket, we're feeling good about where we are."

If we talk about the first half, in the last couple quarters you talked about some push-outs that sounded a little more company-specific, not your fault, but nonetheless a design win that just wasn't going to ramp. Is the weakness you're seeing now something that's market-wide, or is there something a little more indie-specific in 1Q and 2Q?"

        "speaker_name": null,
        "speaker_title": null,
        "text": "No, the weakness is market-wide, and Typically, I mean, if you look at our ramp last year, we incrementally grew $10 million in revenue every quarter on quarter, and that's approximately what we expect in the back half. The new ramps that we have trickle out in Q1, gain a little momentum in Q2, and gain more momentum Q3 and Q4. The early part of the year is typically where we're most susceptible to macro because we don't have offsetting ramps, which are really kicking into high gear in order to offset. So first half, very much macro. Second half, very much positively company-specific in this case."

If we put those together, how should we think about, and otherwise flats are the kind of dollars you could grow? And I know you're not going to measure each one of them individually, but the outgrowth, the supersized growth that you're referring to, give us an idea of what that means."

Next year should really return to supersized growth because we're beginning to actually see the design wins that were made in the early stages of us being a public company roll into the annual revenue streams, and they are significantly larger in size than the traditional wins that we had originally made when we were private, which we we rode the wave of through the first three years as a public company. So we're super excited about that because just the size is that much bigger and we got to sit at the adult table in order to win those designs.

We'll be beyond that in time. But these are dollar content opportunities which are ranging in the $100 range. And it's something that we are very excited about for the long-term future. There will be a huge amount of differentiation that goes not only with the hardware, but with the algorithms that we run on top of it. So it is something that we are pursuing very actively, and the market is very ripe for it. The level of interest in it is super high. Likely, we'll have the... the privilege of being able to choose who we work with on this because the interest level is high and simply we won't have the bandwidth to support the whole market in one go.
