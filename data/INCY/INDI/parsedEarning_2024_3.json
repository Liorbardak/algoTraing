        "text": "Thanks, Ashish. and welcome everybody. Let me first briefly cover our financial performance within the context of the overall automotive market environment before focusing on Indy's business achievements. During the third quarter of 2024, Indy achieved total revenue of $54 million, coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. Given the persisting unfavorable global macroeconomic environment and the well-reported short-term challenges impacting the automotive industry, These results are a testament to Indy's resilience. As we look forward, the growth reflected in our fourth quarter outlook and strategic backlog update highlights our ability to take share and outperform. Last quarter, we highlighted some of the factors negatively impacting the automotive industry, including the high cost of credit influencing consumer purchasing decisions and the ongoing elevated levels of vehicle and semiconductor inventory. We also noted that these challenges were widely anticipated to persist through the second half of 2024. Fast forward 90 days, this is indeed what the industry has experienced. But to paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of the automotive industry's demise were greatly exaggerated. While we still see some uncertainty for the automotive market, the long-term market drivers of in-cabin experience, safety, and electrification remain strong. with safety and electrification being further accelerated by stringent new global regulations and increasingly demanding vehicle assessment programs from NHTSA and Euro NCAP. INDI remains incredibly well positioned to deliver growth across these three megatrends, leveraging our innovative and growing product portfolio to secure design wins which will translate into significant volume shipments in global production vehicles. Additionally, the Chinese automotive industry, EVs in particular, are showing relative strength And to that end, demand for Indy's ICs in China remained strong through the quarter. Let's turn to our business progress in the third quarter across our focus sectors. The news for the quarter across our target markets was unequivocally positive. We continue to gain commercial customer traction with our class-leading products. For ADAS, starting with Vision, our recently launched Indy 880 Vision Processor family is driving new design wins by hitting the customer sweet spot of performance, power, and cost requirements. In exhaustive customer testing, our solution is demonstrably exceeding the performance requirements of the upcoming and very rigorous US and European safety regulation for vulnerable road users that I discussed last quarter. Additionally, the numerous European and Asia-based OEM design and activities across occupant and driver monitoring applications that we also highlighted last time for Indy 880 and its predecessor products continue apace. And in China, the popular Avatar eVehicle is now on the road with our Vision Processor, supplying eMirror solutions. We're also delighted that the Indy 880 Processor family was recognized with the Award of Sensor Innovation of the Year by the Autotech Breakthrough Awards last month. Autotech Breakthrough is a leading independent organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies, and products in the automotive and transportation technology markets. Winning this prestigious award in a strong field of peers is an incredible validation of the class leading image signal processing innovation embodied in Indy's latest generation vision products. Our key 77 gigahertz radar program continues to progress well. Our lead customer is advancing through their internal productization stages and we remain steadfastly on track to support our customer to bring our highly competitive radar ECUs to production with multiple OEMs within the 2025 timeline as previously communicated. For LiDAR, our photonics team has secured a customer-funded program for a complete LiDAR optical engine plus a separate design win for a high-performance optical module. Both programs will leverage our world-class in-house optical component and system integration abilities. Moving to in-cabin user experience, I describe in detail last quarter our various lighting, power delivery, and wireless charging products and latest program wins. And all these are progressing well and on schedule for volume deployments commencing now and ramping in 2025. Our commercial momentum is strong, with numerous design wins across Western OEMs, including Porsche, General Motors, Volkswagen, and multiple Ford models. And in China, we are pleased to report Xiaomi, Avatar, BYD, LeeAuto, and many more OEMs are using Indy's ambient lighting ICs. This quarter, I want to highlight an unsung hero and more recent addition to our user experience portfolio, smart connectivity. The transportation and effective reproduction of high bandwidth data across the vehicle is essential for the growing multitude of in-cabin applications supporting audio-video entertainment and ADAS sensor data visualization. Indy's smart connectivity lineup of high-performance interface converters and retimers now has multiple active design engagements with global OEMs, including a large North American vehicle manufacturer. Finally, let me briefly touch upon our electrification portfolio. We have not elaborated on our capabilities in this segment, as our solutions today are primarily custom ASICs commissioned by specific customers. However, it's worth highlighting that Indy's unique engineering capabilities of analog, power management, digital, and system design are highly valued by Tier 1 system integrators who are dissatisfied with off-the-shelf solutions for their electrification applications, compelling them to commission Indy to deliver what they truly need. Although the past several quarters have been challenging, the long-term automotive outlook continues to remain strong. While analysts forecast modest growth in the new vehicle production for 2025, Indy's growth is not dependent on this. Indy continues to remain incredibly well positioned to deliver growth above market and many of our peer groups' projections, leveraging our uniquely differentiated and expanding product portfolio. The best indicator of our design win momentum and success in the field is the size of our strategic backlog, which we update annually in November. As a reminder, for a full definition of our strategic backlog, please see our Q3 earnings press release. We have recently completed this review process, and I'm pleased to share that our strategic backlog has increased to $7.1 billion, up over 12% from $6.3 billion last year and $4.3 billion in 2022. Based on our strategic backlog today, we would expect to achieve annual revenue of greater than $700 million in 2028. ADAS wins comprise over 72% of our updated strategic backlog, with in-cabin user experience and electrification accounting for the balance. The notable additions to our strategic backlog this year include some of the major DMS OMS wins for our Indy 880 Vision Processor family that we shared previously, plus a combination of our next generation wireless charging and smart connectivity solutions. Lastly, I would like to congratulate Raja on his appointment as our full-time Chief Financial Officer. As you know, Raja has served as Chief Accounting Officer from the time of our launch, and more recently as our acting CFO since June when Tom took medical leave. I want to personally thank Raja for his dedication and support over the last months. This promotion is extremely well deserved. Tom, who has been recuperating, will return soon in an advisory capacity to assist with strategic projects. Given Raja's tenure with INDI and Tom's continued engagement with us, we expect a seamless transition. I will now turn the call over to Raja for a discussion of our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook."

        "text": "Thanks, Donald. For the third quarter of 2024, revenue came in at $54 million, slightly above the midpoint of our outlook, up 3.1% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross profit was $27.2 million, or 50.4% gross margin, which was above our outlook and up sequentially, resulting primarily from improved product mix. R&D was $33.7 million, while SG&A was $10.3 million, bringing total operating expenses to $44 million, consistent with that forecast. As a result, our third quarter non-GAAP operating loss was $16.8 million. With net interest expense of $900,000, our net loss was $17.7 million, and loss per share was $0.09, on a base of 199.9 million shares. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the third quarter with total cash, including restricted cash, of $107.2 million versus $122.6 million in Q2, reflecting a net usage of $15.4 million of cash during the quarter. This was primarily comprised of $31.2 million of cash used in operations, partially offset by $10.9 million raised from the ATM facility and $5.7 million increase in our short-term credit facility. The higher than anticipated cash usage in operations during the quarter was primarily driven by an accelerated inventory build in anticipation of future revenue growth. Moving to our outlook, for the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver strong quarter-over-quarter revenue growth within the range of $56 to $60 million, or $58 million at the midpoint. This translates to over 7% sequential growth outpacing projections for the automotive industry. Moving down the income statement, we expect Q4 gross margins to be roughly flat sequentially. We also expect a marginal reduction of OpEx to $43.5 million with approximately $33.5 million of R&D expense and $10 million of SG&A expense in the fourth quarter. Below the line, we anticipate approximately $1.1 million of net interest expense and no taxes. Assuming the midpoint of the revenue range and with 206 million shares outstanding, we expect a 7 cent net loss per share for the fourth quarter. I want to take a moment to address our intensifying focus on operational efficiency and expense management. In my new role, we are conducting a comprehensive review of our cost structure to identify and capitalize on cost improvement opportunities and working capital efficiency across the organization. including manufacturing, engineering, and all administrative functions. The intended result of these initiatives is to pull forward profitability. This is one of the highest priorities for the executive team and particularly important as we navigate the current market environment. We look forward to providing updates as we progress on this front. With that, I'll turn the call back to Donald for his closing comments."

So the 25 revenue growth, thanks for the color there on the consensus estimates. Just to give a sense of what the large radar programs that you announced several quarters ago are doing in terms of initial growth. looks into OEM programs and uptake. And then you mentioned the term customer homologation. I wasn't really familiar with that term, so if that has any impact on the ramp opportunity growth, I'd be helpful to know."

So I definitely see opportunity there, and we look forward to keeping you updated. But we're not changing our view on the break-even point at this point. I think the consensus models have us at roughly $80 million of top line getting to break even, and we're comfortable with that for now."

And quite simply, the reason that we're able to bump the trend is that we've gone through the period where we had delays in program ramps, and we're now beginning to see much more solidity in that.

But probably more importantly, what's the bridge \u2013 that you have to get from this year's revenue to next year's revenue?

And particularly in some of the applications in computer vision, where they're safety related and mandated by law, then they're also going to be deployed in low end vehicles.

The term coined is, you know, moving at China speed. And, you know, we can move things much more quickly in that geography than in others. It is more volatile for that reason. Their behavior of the OEMs is similar to, let's say, a new entrance into the market in e-vehicle space. But we're excited about the market. It's a market we can't afford to ignore.
