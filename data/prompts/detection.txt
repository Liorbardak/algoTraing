This is an explanation text, and at the end of the explanation, there will be an earnings call transcript. Analyze the following earnings call transcript and extract only the sentences where analysts compliment the company’s performance during the quarter.  In many cases the word congratulations or congrats will appear, but not in all cases. Whenever the words congratulations or congrats appear in an analyst response you should take extra care to check if this is a valid compliment. Look for phrases that express positive feedback on results or execution, such as:
   •   “Congrats on a great quarter”
   •   “Congratulations on the strong results”
   •   “Great to see the execution”
   •   “Very good job in the quarter”

Only include compliments that relate specifically to the company’s financial performance or operational execution during the reported quarter.

Exclude any congratulatory messages that relate to:
   •   Personal events (e.g. retirement, promotions, new roles)
   •   Mergers, acquisitions, or strategic announcements not related to performance this quarter
   •   General greetings or non-performance topics

make sure that all the analysts are written, both the analysts who gave compliments and those who did not compliment.
Make sure that every analyst appears in the file exactly once. If the same analyst asked several questions you should count him only once. 
After identifying all compliments (if any), please put them in a JSON structure with the following fields:

- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 1 if the analyst gave a compliment, 0 otherwise
- quoted_compliment: copy the paragraph that contains the compliment exactly as it is written in the text. in case the analyst didn't give a compliment, put ''.

Your response should include only JSON format with the above fields that can be loaded using json.loads(), without any further text.
