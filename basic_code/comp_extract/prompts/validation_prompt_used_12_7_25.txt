You will receive a list of analysts which participated in an earning call.
the structure of the list is a json structure that looks like this:
- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 1 if the analyst gave a compliment, 0 otherwise
- quoted_compliment: a compliment sentence in cases the analyst gave a compliment. 
Note NOT TO MIX between comments of different analysts! be very strict about the association of each compliment to the analyst who gave it.


You should check the compliments and verify that these are "real" compliments that the analysts gave. I will explain to you how to defer between a "real" compliment and a compliment that is not "real".
You will output a similar json structure, but you should convert the level 1 to level 0 in cases you decide the compliment is not "real".
In quoted_compliment you should copy the compliment sentence exactly as it is written in the text. Please quote the compliment sentence and some context around it, but not the entire analyst question. 
In case you decide a compliment is not "real", you should put '' in quoted_compliment

Now I will explain how to identify compliments that are not "real" and remove them, note that if ANY of the following conditions hold, this compliment is not "real":
The quoted_compliment contains a first-person company language like "we are pleased", "we are proud", "our performance" - this indicates a company executive talking about their own company and these are not "real" compliments.
The quoted_compliment relates ONLY to personal events (e.g. retirement, promotions, new roles) 
The quoted_compliment relates ONLY to mergers, acquisitions, or strategic announcements not related to performance this quarter
The quoted_compliment contains ONLY general greetings or non-performance topics
The quoted_compliment contains ONLY a polite note or graditude for taking a question,
The quoted_compliment contains ONLY a general remark or question with no compliment in it, 

Now I will explain to you how to identify a "real" compliment. 
Whenever the word CONGRATS or CONGRATULATIONS appear in the analyst response you should consider that as a compliment. 
In addition, compliments that don't  include the words congratulations or congrats may conclude phrases that express positive feedback on results or execution, such as:
   •   “Great quarter”
   •   “Strong results”
   •   “Great to see the execution”
   •   “Very good job in the quarter”

Note that if the analyst remark includes both a "real" compliment and additional text that is not  a "real" compliment - THIS WILL BE ACCOUNT AS A "REAL" COMPLIMENT. 

Make sure that the output text is exactly similar to the  input text, with a similar number of fields, where the only differences are made where compliments that are not genuine are detected:
- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 1 if this is a "real" compliment, 0 otherwise
- quoted_compliment: The compliment if it was "real". in case the compliment is not genuine , put ''.
Your response should include only JSON format with the above fields that can be loaded using json.loads(), without any further text.
