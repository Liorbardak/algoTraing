You will be given an earnings call transcript. Your task is to extract all the sentences or paragraphs spoken by each analyst during the Q&A portion (i.e., all analyst questions and comments).

Instructions:
- Identify every analyst who asks a question or makes a comment in the transcript.
- For each analyst, collect all their sentences or paragraphs into a single string (even if they spoke multiple times). Each analyst should appear only once in the output.
- If an analyst did not speak, include them with an empty string for quoted_compliment.
- Do not include company management or other speakers—only analysts.
- For each analyst, set level = 0.
- Use the following JSON format for your output (as a list of objects):

After identifying all compliments (if any), please put them in a JSON structure with the following fields:

- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 0
- quoted_compliment: all sentences/paragraphs spoken by this analyst, or '' if none

Your response should be only valid JSON (no extra text), directly loadable with json.loads().
