You know, 4Q has historically been a relatively heavy perpetual license quarter, so maybe if you could gives a little bit more color around what the previous changes in incentive compensations to skew the efforts towards SAS, what the impact is with regard to what you typically see or have typically seen on the perpetual side, and then how do we think about progress with the install base with regard to kind of transitioning the SAS?

We see the elevated R&D costs. Sales and marketing spend is, you know, also elevated relative to historical growth rates.

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition?

It was important that you talked about the maintenance piece of the ARR as well because we do actually, and I called it out in my prepared remarks, that we will probably start to see the decline even on the maintenance ARR, but then the super growth rate on the subscription piece of the ARR. And, you know, the confidence, again, it's really coming from, first of all, the faster transition and also the SaaS-heavy side of the transition. And we're seeing Privileged Cloud really being a big piece of that. And we're also seeing Privileged Cloud also going even further up market. And we talked a little bit about our average deal sizes going up. as well, especially for new logos. And it's really tied to privileged cloud success, also further upmarket, and the value that our customers and the enterprises are seeing in the subscription packages and for the self-hosted as well. You know, I think that, you know, we feel confident about the ARR growth, you know, about overachieving. You know, we put out the number in our guidance, you know, that we feel comfortable given the information we have in front of us. You know, we had great execution in 2021, but, you know, for now the guide is the guide, but absolutely the demand environment is there for us to invest in.____",

So can you unpack that for us and help us get to an understanding of, A, free cash flow for this year and where it's coming in, and then any thoughts relative to how that might accelerate next year in terms of that spread?____ Thank you, guys, and we'd like to echo our thoughts relative to your employees and the people of Israel.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yes, Zach, and thanks for asking. I mean, you know, first of all, you know, obviously we we had a great first quarter on cash flow. It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow.

You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thanks, Adam. So we are, and you've all heard me talk about this opportunity of how we secure access to the cloud. And just to start with, that goes across two of the identity groups that I was describing. The traditional IT users are increasingly having to access not only on-prem targets, but also cloud assets and cloud environments. And we need what would be considered a traditional PAM tool that's able to actually manage those hybrid environments effectively or secure those hybrid environments effectively. And so our ability to be able to take SEA and blend it in within our identity security platform is a key component part of actually how we're staying ahead in securing IT users. Then there is this new population of developers out there. And these developers are hired at an exponential rate. And generally speaking, they're hired to go innovate. And once they start innovating, they're scaling up cloud environments. They have unfettered entitlements and access. And that is just not sustainable. And organizations are understanding that they need to put in place controls in the cloud. So our SCA solution, which allows for zero standing privilege, which is a unique approach, no privileges are assigned until the point of access. allows us to be able to go in and talk to customers about securing that developer population, allowing them to use native tools, and applying security controls at the point of access. So that's a way of building up then to your question, which is, all right, well, what is the differentiation here and how do these other markets play in? When you start to think about CIM, when you start to think even about ITDR, it's about really understanding or discovering what's going on. It's even in some cases about mapping entitlements versus targets. And we have a place to play in those areas, but the major place we play at CyberArk is in enforcement and in controls. And ultimately, once you discover, once you understand, you have to control. And our SCA solution is a light touch, easy to deploy, security first tool we can apply for controlling privilege access and privilege access specifically as people try to access the cloud. So that's just a little bit more background on it. I think it's an opportunity for us to be able to differentiate this cloud access market from some of the other areas that you were describing. And of course, our ability to be able to bring that into the overall platform is what sets us apart.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just on the cloud, it's great to see the continued traction with secure cloud access. And as we think about kind of the cloud opportunity more broadly, you know, we often hear about either Kim or ITDR. I was hoping you could talk more about how you think about these adjacent cloud identity security markets as opportunities for CyberArk over time. Thanks so much.____",

So on the first front when we when we look at the bookings performance in the quarter remember bookings has nothing to do with duration, so the duration we just wanted to be transparent was a bump up in the quarter it's about three and a half million of contribution around revenue. But it but it but it's not a contributing factor to the strength of our overall business, the strength of our overall business. is based upon continued growth across the entire portfolio. We continue to see AAR just grow really strongly for each piece of the platform. Now, I highlighted in the call kind of particular strength in the secrets management business, and I'm very excited by that because that, again, is showing our ability to compete effectively as a security sale in the machine identity space. So I would highlight that. I would also highlight, as we talked about earlier, our ability to be able to go back into the base and expand customers beyond PAM or securing IT into new areas like securing developers or our ability to be able to go compete effectively in the quarter around workforce and our differentiated workforce solution. So across the board, I can point to the entire portfolio, talk about strong bookings, and that kind of comes from that overall approach. Remind me again of the second question?",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Thanks. I have two questions. Maybe I'll show them all at once. First for you, Josh, on the bookings upside, Can you give us a little bit more color there on how much of that is duration, new customers, expansion activities stronger than you expected, the mix of products there, any color would be great. And Matt, going back to the point you mentioned to the question of EPM being complementary to EDR, it is complementary today, but clearly more and more of your portfolio right now is at the edge. I would think the browser, I would think about that as an edge product as well. And so as you're moving closer and closer to the edge, can your EPM product evolve into an EDR-like product and be competitive with an EDR solution?____",

And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here. I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere. That all makes sense. And you guys, like I said, have executed well. But I guess ARR was strong this quarter, my follow-up here. And it was in the range of what we thought you could do, and that's great. But just curious if you saw any influence on this last quarter due to the U.S. election, and if you did, how do you see this influencing business going forward, if at all? Great. Thank you and congrats to the team.____",

It looks like Venify is contributing about 160 million of ARR to the full year. I'm curious. You know, how quickly was Venify ARR growing, exiting kind of the Q3 quarter, and do you have a rough estimate of what that SAS mix was for Q3?",
