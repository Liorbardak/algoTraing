I'm curious how you're doing with some of the integration of the acquisitions you've made over the last 18 months, particularly BTG in this current environment and what you're really seeing there. And then my second question is, I'm looking generally in life right now for silver linings. So during this period of time, what are you learning either about your business or your employees that help you on the other side? Maybe it's telemedicine, maybe it's expenses, maybe it's something else, thank you.",

So that also seems encouraging. And I guess I was just hoping to get some color on how you're able to do that with the COVID flare-ups because, you know, that does – kind of fly in the face of it, but it seems like you're optimistic you'll be returning to a more normal pace here. ____ ",

You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any Lotus charges, so that's good. And really what it just shows is the broad adoption and enthusiasm for Watchman Flex. So we'll be easily done with a full Watchman conversion in the second quarter. It's well on its way now. And so most of our customers want it. use and the momentum that it has. So that really exceeded it. We expect to have a great year with Watchman in 2021 and beyond. The option trial will finish enrolling by year end. The champion trial is enrolling now. There's a portfolio of enhancements behind Watchman Flex, and there's a lot of momentum with that business. So that's really good.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Oh, great. Thanks. And good morning. Morning. So, Mike, just to start, if OK, I wanted to ask a big picture question, because obviously, historically, investors are used to Boston growing above MedTech peers. And with the 2021 guide you're giving us today is, I think you said, zero to five percent organic revenue growth over 2019. And zero to five is not a premium to what we're hearing from others. And it's actually below some that have guided for It's that same time period. So when do you think Boston can once again start to show revenues that look better than your peers? Is that now more of a 2022 event in your mind? Thank you.____",

You saw in second quarter the impact of some of our businesses like spinal cord stimulators and Euro PH. fell, I think Nerva was down 40% in the second quarter and Euro was down 30%. And you saw them snap back very quickly when the COVID impact improved in the third quarter. And then obviously COVID came back stronger again. So I'd say the business responds very quickly once the COVID impact stabilizes and decreases and as vaccines will become more prominent, you'll see a sharp recovery of these businesses. As you saw, fourth quarter grew. You know, PI grew 5%. The BTG interventional grew double-digit. Packet tax grew plus 20%. Endo and Euro grew. So some of our businesses are just more impacted, namely spinal cord stimulation, urology, and some of our core CRM IC businesses. And as COVID improves, we've seen that it steps back pretty quickly, and that's where you see a very bullish second-half guide when we feel the impact will be minimized. Thank you.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on the guidance for Dan and, well, maybe two on the guidance. First, Dan, the guidance implies sales of about $11.5 billion at the midpoint, if I'm doing the math right, which is above your 2019 sales. But EPS are expected to be slightly below at the midpoint for 2021 relative to 2019. I know you gave a lot of helpful color on how to think about the P&L, but At a high level, why would sales be meaningfully above in 2021 but EPS slightly below? And I had one follow-up. Perfect. And then, you know, Mike, given how elective your procedures are, you know, what are your expectations for a potential catch-up in deferred procedures that, you know, were obviously deferred in 2019?

We've placed a number of capital units in U.S. and some of the Western markets in Europe. So the capital is in place, and the sales team is in place. The outpatient reimbursement is quite healthy for that product, which is great, and they're building new clinical evidence. In the near term here, the challenge continues to be access. having our teams accessible to the suites to really drive what is kind of a behavior change in using a single-use scope. And so as COVID continues to improve, this will be a great growth driver for us in 2021. And it'll get better and better each quarter, just like we're seeing now. However, the ability for us to really turn on accounts in high utilization is difficult, given the limitations of some of the rep access and the hesitancy to modify kind of current practices in a COVID world. But we have seen some success for sure. And our team, the reimbursement is very helpful. And as the year goes on, that will become a more meaningful growth driver each quarter for us. And we'll launch the Broncoscope in the second half of 2021. And we believe this will be a nice $2 billion market for us. And we think it will follow a very similar path. ex-COVID as our urology scope did, as well as our spyglass scope and endo as well. So we have a lot of experience there. We know how to make these devices. You'll see enhancements to Exal-D likely in the second half of the year as well. And as COVID continues to wane down, that business will accelerate in 21.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Good morning, everybody. Two questions. Exalt D, you've been very forthright in sharing how the pandemic has slowed uptake of this. And can we think about how, in an improving environment, you look to launch it in a more constructive way? Thanks. And my second question has to do with the peripheral intervention business. That's the business that seems to be gaining momentum and gaining it on the back of BTG also. And how do you think about that rolling out throughout the year?

So we have no shortage of product launches that we're launching right now. clinical trial, I would say it's a bit mixed. The Watchman clinical trials have ramped very, very quickly with the option trial, the champion trial starting. Some of the trials that require new therapies have been a bit slower. We are excited about the Mitral approval to begin that clinical trial in the U.S., which is a nice win for us. We had some challenges trying to do that overseas given the COVID impact. The Exalt B we already talked about. So, you know, I would say it's a bit of a kind of a mixed result depending on which business you're in. But in some of the markets, it may be about a six-month impact in terms of enrollment timing. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for Accurate. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for Cryo. So maybe there's some impact maybe the six-months",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Oh, great. Thanks for taking the question. You know, not to beat a dead horse here, but I wanted to touch on guidance for a second and really just hit on the strategy that you took when approaching it. You know, it's still we're in the middle of COVID, and I understand you're planning for a more normal second half. But just want to understand, you know, especially after last year and 2019, how much room is there on the downside should the virus really, the impact extend, vaccine rollout continues at a slow pace? You know, how much downside have you planned for in guidance? Just trying to think, you know, how conservative it is versus some of the worser case scenarios. Got it. And then maybe just to follow up, you know, as we look at some of the new product launches, it looks like you have basically your 2020 slate will be launching here. We have Waverider. We have Exalti, which you touched on. You know, how should we think about 2022 and beyond? I know you have the slide there, but how delayed has some of your new product launches been? How has patient enrollment been? And do you expect any gaps in new product launches due to the trial enrollment environment? Thanks.____",

The China business, we're comfortable with strong double-digit growth in 2021. The DES business, as I mentioned, is only about 5% of our mix. And you've got great balance of our complex coronary PI and other businesses there. So China will have a strong year this year. You are seeing some minor flare-ups in China with COVID in the near term, but they've done a remarkable job of managing it. You are seeing some flare-ups of COVID in Japan as well. But, you know, so I think overall Asia business likely could be stronger given the impact of COVID.

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, so if you think about that, you take a step back and look at third quarter, and that's why I started my script that I'm really proud of the team's global execution. Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good.",

You know, our PI business has been very resilient consistently. Drives consistent high performance. We're the number one DCB player now in Japan. The team's done a great job with that launch. And the TheraSphere platform continues to do extremely well. And you saw that clinical data. So, you know, that division continues to do very well. Endo, I would put him despite COVID, grew 8% versus 19 in the quarter. And a number of new product launches. Euro has been impacted by COVID, but That typically bounces back when COVID improves. And we've got a lot of commentary and watchmen today. We saw strong EP growth in Europe. We continue to lag in the U.S., but the EP momentum we see in Europe and Japan is very encouraging based on our cryo capabilities as well as the early insights into FerriPulse.

I wanted to ask specifically just your comments on pain and SES, really what you saw in the quarter, especially as it pertains to recent headwinds prior auth, and then just your outlook in terms of underlying market growth. Did we see some recapture in one queue? Was that part of the strength in how you're thinking about underlying market growth going forward? Great. And if I could just quickly follow up on China, some of your comments, what you saw in the quarter, coming in ahead of expectations, how should we think about really just the rest of the 23 in terms of pent-up demand, backlog procedures, and then also what you've seen to date with Watchman in the region? And thanks for taking the questions. Good quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. ____ Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question and also echoing my congrats on the quarter.",

    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on another home run quarter. Wanted to just check the box. Mike, you called out your ops and supply chain team for keeping up with the demand for Farrah Pulse and staying on top. I just want to make sure that there's no manufacturing capacity issues next year if that franchise continues to outperform internal expectations. And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter, but I wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment. I mean, our understanding is that mapping capital and diagnostic mapping catheters, kind of the percentage of the overall ablation market, it's even higher than the ablation catheter segment. I know you guys are now well-positioned there, but just to review that and maybe just the revenue, the business model for Boston Scientific, whether this FairPulse NAV will be single use for PVIs and then just how you're building out your diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio. Sorry for the multi-part. Just in terms of the diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio build-out, you guys do have a high-density mapping catheter in the pipeline, is my understanding, but just wanted to get a better look on that. I'll just add on, and then we'll move on to the next one. There are elements of the procedure that we don't compete in today, that pie, like ice catheters and others. So we're doing extremely well in the ablation portion of it. We expect OPAL to do quite well in the mapping segment, which we've been – underscaled in, but there's still segments within the EP procedure mix that we don't plan today that we're shooting to fill out in the portfolio over time. I'll just make one other comment on Ferripulse relates to China for, it wasn't a question, but we're excited about the approval in Japan and in China. We do expect the China launch to be a bit slower. than what you typically see in the US and Japan based on obviously not product or team, but it's more on getting approvals and registries and launch cadence in terms of the volume of new accounts. We've done some recent openings there that have gone quite well, but we don't anticipate the same aggressive launch in China that you've seen in US. We do expect to have a very strong launch in Japan. And also just a shout out to the China team. Despite the significant VBP headwinds that we've seen, which have impacted our IBIS franchise. There'll be more VBPs in 2025. You know, we continue to grow essentially at the company average in China, despite those headwinds, when many of our peers have faced tougher results.____",
