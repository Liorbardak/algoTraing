And so as the first quarter that is chewing on some old pipeline, you can say we have some old pipeline that we expected to continue to sell as perpetual, but very pleased with how the mix is. has outperformed and very pleased with how it's looking in the current full-year Q2 and full-year pipeline. So I would say no pushback, but actually better than expected transition and really the way we wanted to start this year.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So I'm just curious what kind of pushback you may have gotten.

So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter.",

Josh, since I have you, any high-level modeling points or expectations you could point us to as it relates to the subscription revenue and subscription ARR mix between SaaS and on-prem?

I think we've invested the last several quarters on really integrating it to create 1 plus 1 equals 11 with being part of connected into PAM and part of the identity security portfolio. And we've also invested in putting overlay sales effort there. So we are It's still early innings for adaptive standalone, but we're seeing it, and some of the examples I've given, really play well in the cross-sell, up-sell motion with existing customers, and also as a new landing front for us, as a tip of the spear, as Matt called it, in the investor day. And so it's an early, young speedboat within CyberArk, But it's really taking off well. And, Rob, you know, on the AAR growth question, you know, we're still very much looking at 30% growth for the year on AAR. And, you know, we started off nicely on the first quarter with 41%, 30-plus percent organically, and we see that continuing through the year. All right, thanks.",

They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year.",

And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security.

You know, I think from, you know, really if you're talking about the accounting, you know, we talked about, you know, the headwind as it relates, you know, to our SaaS and subscription rate. For the subscription, you know, for the subscription side of the business on-prem, term-based licenses. We're looking at it going out between 50% up front, and for the new packages, it's closer to 70%. 30% upfront and 70% pro-rata over time. And on SaaS, obviously, it's fully ratable. So that goes, obviously, into the headwind calculation for the guidance. And we're pleased with the guidance to be able to, one, increase our anticipated subscription bookings mix and still really come in at what we anticipated on a revenue perspective for Q2. So from that perspective, what it really supports, and we think about it also from an annual basis, it really supports the fact that our pipeline is growing nicely. It's actually, when you think about our subscription mix and the increased headwind performance, For the quarter and for the full year, we're actually really raising our expectations for the business, you know, for the next nine months.

So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals?

Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 versus the scenario FROM Q2 a year ago. And already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that's why, you know, we see a slight decline in the headwind, but, you know, we're still supporting the strong revenue growth. With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, You know, we're real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it's certainly happening definitely within our original goalposts of 8 to 10 quarters. We're able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple of percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think Q1 is still one quarter of work. But, you know, we'll see how Q2 goes and we'll be able to, I think, based off of the first half of the year, really reevaluate again, you know, the full transition period. But, you know, I think in order to bring it in, we'll want to see, you know, we'll want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far, we like what we see.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. First off, Your contribution from subscription bookings, I think, was 20% in the year-ago quarter. It expanded to 51%. It seems like that's moving very quickly. What will it take for you to accelerate your timeline for reaching that 70% to 80%? I think you would. suggested it would be 8 to 10 quarters out. So what do you think the likelihood of that happening before the end of fiscal 22? And then secondly, I think you had indicated that your headwind projected for Q2 is about $9 million. I think it was $11 million in the March quarter here. Why will it be coming down in the June quarter from the March quarter? This concludes our question and answer session.

And in fact, customers will see them come in, hear the pitch, and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the slimmed down initial versions of their products. So are we seeing a stimulation in demand for privilege access as a result of the lightweight competitive entry?",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Great. Thank you very much. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, and not in the way that I think most people are thinking about it. So there's a lot of, you know, blurring in swim lanes with people like SailPoint, Nocta, and even HashiCorp getting into your space. But my sense is that that actually has resulted in an increase in demand for your products, as they have stimulated awareness but not necessarily impacted the share. And in fact, customers will see them come in, hear the pitch, and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the slimmed down initial versions of their products. So are we seeing a stimulation in demand for privilege access as a result of the lightweight competitive entry? Thanks, Alex, and I love your angle here. I think first and foremost is the increased demand environment and our increased leadership position based on merit, you know, having the better products that address all of the broad use cases and definitely privilege access management. and expanding to identity. I do agree that there's been more publicity to the space from that perspective with announcements of entry of very early products where we do not see those products in the field and customers have heard of those pre-announcements. And, you know, I don't know how much we factor that into the awareness, but the awareness is up across the board for identity security. And that may be probably some contributing factor, but the biggest thing are the demand drivers and, you know, all of these years of focusing on the customers and focusing on being a broad platform for identity is huge. you know, it's bearing fruit for us in a very strong competitive position, as strong as I can remember. Great. Thanks. Thank you.____Congrats on the strong quarter.",

And I only had one sentence for it, but I'm super excited about EPM for Linux because, first of all, EPM... is one of our strong performance and more than double for us along with the other SaaS solutions. And I would say from a leadership position, it's just a great, we're in a great place. But we've been addressing so far Windows endpoints and Windows servers and endpoints and Mac endpoints. And this really takes us to the Linux platforms. Both servers and there are, of course, Linux endpoints as well and really taking us into our customers' cloud environments and for those who are hybrid to their data centers and giving them that same easy to manage policies for least privilege for the Linux environment, which is so important in preventing ransomware and privilege escalation and all the, I would say, non-repeatable points of attack. So I would say it's within the huge stand that we're addressing, but we went after the Windows environments first, and the team and our channels are very excited about this, and we'll make more of a splash at our impact event. From a competitive standpoint, I talked about standalone. We have been fully partnering with the EDR vendors to date. EPM is not an EDR solution. It's an identity security solution for enforcing least privilege on the endpoint, and we think that it applies just the same as we expand to the Linux environment. But from a standalone competitive standpoint, it gives us even an additional advantage to what we have today to be able to basically cover all platforms, and again, leverage the multiple landing points we have now to also Linux.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, so thanks, Hamza. I mean, with regard to your first question, you know, we're very confident about what's going on this year. Obviously, the economy will do what the economy was doing. But I think Uri addressed it earlier on today that, you know, we have, you know, a very strong, resilient type of a business model that is basically, especially now with us hitting our subscription mix of over 85%, where we're really now driving towards going through to the other side of the transition towards growth and profitability. And when we think about this year, the demand environment has not changed, and if anything, has strengthened in the course of time. I mean, I think we saw news even this morning of pretty material events in Costa Rica. And so we're continuing to invest. However, I will point out that we're an experienced management team, and we already talked about this before. So we understand that we're constantly monitoring the situation, but at this point we're very confident on where the business is, where our pipeline is, and the demand environment around cyber. So, you know, it's still ahead. And on the second question, remind me, if it was the second question. Yeah, so I think, you know, clearly where, you know, as we get further and further into the year where the delta on the mix It gets smaller and smaller, so we have much bigger compares when we get into the second half of the year, so you're going to see a smaller growth in ARR, and we started off with a very strong growth of 48% in the first quarter. So I think that it'll go kind of in tandem with the narrowing of the headwind delta between the high 80s that we're doing in subscription business this year versus, you know, versus the 70s that we did last year. And so Q3 and Q4 will, you know, we'll have the narrowest jump. Thank you.",

The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect. So, I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. You know, we feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment.

So can you unpack that for us and help us get to an understanding of, A, free cash flow for this year and where it's coming in, and then any thoughts relative to how that might accelerate next year in terms of that spread?____ Thank you, guys, and we'd like to echo our thoughts relative to your employees and the people of Israel.",

Clearly, everyone would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your salesforce right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance, and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the three-year mark of the real big shift in subscription.

Is there a risk that they – not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted to cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they – shift from one tool to another help me understand that transition why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step downs sorry for the long question no no it's good good questions and again thanks for the support on the go-to-market side i",

It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow.

So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level.

I have been called Don before, but anyway, Mike, I don't mean to beat a dead horse on this, but really, I think I'm curious, like why Venify represents an incremental growth plan for you? Matt, you talked about the go-to-market push, and that makes some sense. And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here. And you guys have executed really well, and that's part of it too, right? That's positive. But I don't know, if you could speak a little bit to that. I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere.",

I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere. That all makes sense. And you guys, like I said, have executed well. But I guess ARR was strong this quarter, my follow-up here. And it was in the range of what we thought you could do, and that's great. But just curious if you saw any influence on this last quarter due to the U.S. election, and if you did, how do you see this influencing business going forward, if at all? Great. Thank you and congrats to the team.____",
