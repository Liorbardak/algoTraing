Maybe for Matt, I know you talked about in your prepared remarks the ability to unleash your go-to-market motion on over 8,500 non-Venify customers now within your install base. Can you talk a little bit about what needs to be done within your direct sales force and then what you're doing within the channel and perhaps how long that will take to have an effect on the trajectory of Venify's growth rate?

It seems like awareness is raising there. I'm wondering, based off your conversations with customers, do you think that we're getting into the actual adoption curve where customers are looking to pick up post-quantum security tools, some of the stuff you're talking about with being able to gauge exposure and get to a place of certificate agility there? And now with Venify and the platform, is there any sense of how material you think this could be as a driver in the next year? And then I have a quick follow-up. Great. Thanks again.____",

You talked about the platform selling approach being great traction, especially with some of the wins you talked about. Now, I'm just curious maybe from a technology perspective under the hood, especially as we now fold in Medify, how do we think about how – integrated, as we call it, the human side of the portfolio is today. You talked about efforts to integrate secrets and Venify. And how should I think about almost a converged human slash non-human identity portfolio on the back end in coming years? Thanks so much. That all makes sense. And you guys, like I said, have executed well. But I guess ARR was strong this quarter, my follow-up here. And it was in the range of what we thought you could do, and that's great. But just curious if you saw any influence on this last quarter due to the U.S. election, and if you did, how do you see this influencing business going forward, if at all? Great.

Matt, you talked about the go-to-market push, and that makes some sense. And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here.
