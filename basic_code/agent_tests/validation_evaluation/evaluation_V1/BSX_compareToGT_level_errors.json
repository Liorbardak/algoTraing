And I guess I'm just wondering if your positivity on July is, you think, differentially related to your portfolio, your products, your exposures, or Are we seeing just the benefit of having more hindsight, and do you think that we're seeing more broad recovery through the month for the MedTech space? Okay. And one follow-up, you know, in the supplemental presentation and the prepared commentary, you talked about being able to resume a normal pace of account openings for Lotus and restarting a lot of your clinical trial activities. So that also seems encouraging. And I guess I was just hoping to get some color on how you're able to do that with the COVID flare-ups because, you know, that does – kind of fly in the face of it, but it seems like you're optimistic you'll be returning to a more normal pace here. ____ ",

Maybe you can help us understand a little more. At the end of March, we spoke to nine or 10 gastroenterologists.
