REVISED PROMPT:

In the following earnings call transcript, your task is to identify and extract only the sentences where analysts compliment the company’s performance during the quarter. 

Compliments may not always be explicit and may not always include the words 'congratulations' or 'congrats'. They can be phrases that express positive feedback on results or execution. Here are some examples of compliments:
   •   “Congrats on a great quarter”
   •   “Congratulations on the strong results”
   •   “Great to see the execution”
   •   “Very good job in the quarter”
   •   "Strong performance"
   •   "Good quarter"
   •   "Great quarter"
   •   "Good job on the quarter"
   •   "Strong execution"
   •   "Nice performance this quarter"
   •   "Impressive results"
   •   "Very strong quarter"
   •   "Another home run quarter"

Please note that compliments should relate specifically to the company’s financial performance or operational execution during the reported quarter. 

Do not consider as compliments any congratulatory messages that relate to:
   •   Personal events (e.g. retirement, promotions, new roles)
   •   Mergers, acquisitions, or strategic announcements not related to performance this quarter
   •   General greetings or non-performance topics

Also, ensure that all the analysts are written, both the analysts who gave compliments and those who did not compliment. Each analyst should appear in the file exactly once. If the same analyst asked several questions you should count him only once. 

After identifying all compliments (if any), please put them in a JSON structure with the following fields:

- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 1 if the analyst gave a compliment, 0 otherwise
- quoted_compliment: copy the paragraph that contains the compliment exactly as it is written in the text. in case the analyst didn't give a compliment, put ''.

Your response should include only JSON format with the above fields that can be loaded using json.loads(), without any further text.

Please be aware that not all positive statements about the company's performance are compliments. For instance, an analyst expressing excitement or satisfaction about the company's performance, or stating that the company's performance exceeded expectations, does not necessarily constitute a compliment. A compliment should be a clear and direct praise of the company's performance.
