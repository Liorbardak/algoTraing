And then my second question is, I'm looking generally in life right now for silver linings. So during this period of time, what are you learning either about your business or your employees that help you on the other side? Maybe it's telemedicine, maybe it's expenses, maybe it's something else, thank you."

So first on Watchman, you know, one of the things investors are paying attention to is, you know, potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the most from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the Watchman business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there. And I'll just ask my second now. On Exalt-B, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be. But, you know, hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much."

You won't see any more consignment charges this year nor any Lotus charges, so that's good. And really what it just shows is the broad adoption and enthusiasm for Watchman Flex. So we'll be easily done with a full Watchman conversion in the second quarter. It's well on its way now. And so most of our customers want it. use and the momentum that it has. So that really exceeded it. We expect to have a great year with Watchman in 2021 and beyond. The option trial will finish enrolling by year end. The champion trial is enrolling now.

And you saw them snap back very quickly when the COVID impact improved in the third quarter. And then obviously COVID came back stronger again. So I'd say the business responds very quickly once the COVID impact stabilizes and decreases and as vaccines will become more prominent, you'll see a sharp recovery of these businesses. As you saw, fourth quarter grew. You know, PI grew 5%. The BTG interventional grew double-digit. Packet tax grew plus 20%. Endo and Euro grew. So some of our businesses are just more impacted, namely spinal cord stimulation, urology, and some of our core CRM IC businesses. And as COVID improves, we've seen that it steps back pretty quickly, and that's where you see a very bullish second-half guide when we feel the impact will be minimized. Thank you."

We've placed a number of capital units in U.S. and some of the Western markets in Europe. So the capital is in place, and the sales team is in place. The outpatient reimbursement is quite healthy for that product, which is great, and they're building new clinical evidence. In the near term here, the challenge continues to be access. having our teams accessible to the suites to really drive what is kind of a behavior change in using a single-use scope. And so as COVID continues to improve, this will be a great growth driver for us in 2021. And it'll get better and better each quarter, just like we're seeing now. However, the ability for us to really turn on accounts in high utilization is difficult, given the limitations of some of the rep access and the hesitancy to modify kind of current practices in a COVID world. But we have seen some success for sure. And our team, the reimbursement is very helpful. And as the year goes on, that will become a more meaningful growth driver each quarter for us. And we'll launch the Broncoscope in the second half of 2021. And we believe this will be a nice $2 billion market for us. And we think it will follow a very similar path. ex-COVID as our urology scope did, as well as our spyglass scope and endo as well. So we have a lot of experience there. We know how to make these devices. You'll see enhancements to Exal-D likely in the second half of the year as well. And as COVID continues to wane down, that business will accelerate in 21."

So we have no shortage of product launches that we're launching right now. clinical trial, I would say it's a bit mixed. The Watchman clinical trials have ramped very, very quickly with the option trial, the champion trial starting. Some of the trials that require new therapies have been a bit slower. We are excited about the Mitral approval to begin that clinical trial in the U.S., which is a nice win for us. We had some challenges trying to do that overseas given the COVID impact. The Exalt B we already talked about. So, you know, I would say it's a bit of a kind of a mixed result depending on which business you're in. But in some of the markets, it may be about a six-month impact in terms of enrollment timing. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for Accurate. We're enrolling the U.S. trial for Cryo. So maybe there's some impact maybe the six-months"

The China business, we're comfortable with strong double-digit growth in 2021. The DES business, as I mentioned, is only about 5% of our mix. And you've got great balance of our complex coronary PI and other businesses there. So China will have a strong year this year. You are seeing some minor flare-ups in China with COVID in the near term, but they've done a remarkable job of managing it. You are seeing some flare-ups of COVID in Japan as well. But, you know, so I think overall Asia business likely could be stronger given the impact of COVID.

Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good."

And the TheraSphere platform continues to do extremely well. And you saw that clinical data. So, you know, that division continues to do very well. Endo, I would put him despite COVID, grew 8% versus 19 in the quarter. And a number of new product launches. Euro has been impacted by COVID, but That typically bounces back when COVID improves. And we've got a lot of commentary and watchmen today. We saw strong EP growth in Europe. We continue to lag in the U.S., but the EP momentum we see in Europe and Japan is very encouraging based on our cryo capabilities as well as the early insights into FerriPulse. I don't know if I answered your question, but... I'm actually, as I said in the call, I'm really pleased with the quarter given the macro headwinds that the company faced."

The Q1 strength would insist in, you know, what specifically are you assuming for China impact? You know, similarly on EPS. It was raised by one cent at the low end, right, given the debt-free-fied bail list. Looks like operating margin is in line-ish. Maybe talk about the annual guidance for a second."

I just wanted to get a sense of the recovery within the quarter, and I just wanted to bounce something off you and see how this will translate to the rest of the year. So our sense from reports to date and from talking to some other privately held companies is that the first half of the quarter, you saw suppressed procedure volumes, then a quick rebound, and everything got compressed. into the quarter within itself the um compressed procedure trends i'm sorry suppressed procedure trends and then the recovery whereas previously it was like down one quarter the recovery the next quarter do you guys think you saw that is my first question and then as we think about the rest of the year and potentially more covid waves do you think the recovery from here is going to look more like that or there's risk excuse me of the volatility that we saw previously i guess what i'm getting at is Is there still a backlog of patients, number one? Number two, do we think this is going to be more consistent, more linear going forward? Sorry, that was a long question."

Fourth quarter continues to look good in guidance. I think the one area where we're seeing a little pressure is on margins. So, Dan, I was hoping you might be able to give us an early look into next year. How elevated is the spending? There's a lot of moving pieces with OpEx and currency and the share count. You know, do you think the street's generally in a decent spot for next year with returning to more normalized margin expansion, or do you think it's still going to be a pressured year in 2023? Thanks."

And I guess I'm thankful that I've got about six months to get to know this humorous side that everyone's referring to. So I look forward to that. Just one follow-up, if I could, on margins. Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the three-cent reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. There's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative, just given the strengths, but love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 23, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 23 some of the higher costs will go and If we were to think about, is that sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 23 at this point, or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on.

You're guiding today to 10% to 12% organic growth. So the question is, do you still expect growth to accelerate in 2025?

I mean, a CRM mid-single-digit growth is very strong. Interventional cardiology of double digits, very strong. Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in interventional cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stem portfolio, obviously, and then CRM. Can they sustain these kinds of growth profiles, given that the end markets are, from a volume perspective, are arguably probably some of your slower growth end markets?

Could you give us any kind of update or parameters on on how many centers you're in, how many boxes you've placed, and maybe talk about whether the early experience has changed your views on how the market could evolve like you laid out at the analyst day several months ago."

You know, Dr. Stein, given the importance of Farapulse, can you provide more color on the Avant Garde trial and the observations you saw? And, you know, related to that, there are going to be more PFA ablation choices soon, including from the market leader. You know, once these new PFA catheters are launched, what are the factors that will lead existing Farapulse customers to stay with Farapulse or choose Farapulse if they haven't adopted it yet? Thank you."

I had a question just on, maybe for Dan, on some of the dynamics in the gross margin line in the quarter. You mentioned FX being kind of one of the primary headwinds, but as you move into 25, maybe you can talk a little bit about you know, where the leverage in the model is. It's, you know, table gross margin and levering some of the operating investments that you're making, but maybe just some color on how you see that progressing at this point. Thanks."

Just wanted to ask, I appreciate there's not going to be a lot. You can say, Dan, appreciate the comments that you did give on 2025, but specifically as we think about sales, you noted above market sales growth. I mean, market can be a moving target a little bit here about how you think about the markets growing next year. So I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more color if possible, even if it's just highlighting tailwinds and headwinds from a sales growth perspective to think about as we look ahead to 2025. Thanks so much."

You go back to the October 18th press release and you have Farrow Wave Navcatheter out there, but it indicates that it's exclusive to Opal on the mapping side. So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year and presumably we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach So maybe the question here is just when we enter 25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers. So maybe just walk through that dynamic a little bit. Congratulations again on the quarter."

What is the regulatory strategy? Do you expect to file with the FDA?

And I'd much rather focus on all the positive things going on here, but I'm looking at the stock down now versus up prior to this avant-garde commentary. So, Dr. Stein, I'm not sure exactly what you can say, but is there any kind of safety signal that we should be aware of? And then if you can't comment on that, is there anything to think about in terms of this patient population really being the cause of the difference, maybe extra lesions that need to be created? um, higher risk, you know, benefit requirements because it's drug naive patients. Um, just anything along those lines that you can share, um, because I think folks are pretty nervous this morning just based on, uh, how important Ferrapulse is to the, to the business. Thanks."
