So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition? And to put it bluntly, do you feel like you've given yourself enough wiggle room to really outperform like you did last year?"

I guess during the onset of the pandemic when you saw a little pullback in deal sizes and how the platform was being consumed, given the mix that you have now with greater SaaS mix and the greater awareness, how do you think about the durability of growth?

Udi, some security and broader software vendors who have recently reported earnings have spoken about longer sales cycles among larger enterprise customers. Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise, so I just wanted to... you know, confirmed that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level. And then secondly, for Josh, you know, did the prior ARR guidance, which I believe was 535 to 541, did that not include any FX headwinds? Just wanted to clarify that as well. Thanks."

As we think about the guidance and the setup for the back half of the year, how do you think about seasonality, perhaps a mix of term and SAS in there, and how do we get confidence? I mean, it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance. and the level of confidence you have to hit that and considerations you might need to make as we, you know, fine tune our model."

Udi, you had a brief mention of Zero Trust as being an influencer and was wondering if you could maybe give a little color around how that influenced the strong performance, if at all, as far as new customer logos in 230 or so for the quarter, which was we thought was strong. So is there a dynamic there where that type of architecture around zero trust is actually driving those engagements on the identity piece?

So, could you just talk to us about your top three priorities for the company as CyberArts scales beyond that $1 billion in ARR by around fiscal year 25? Yes, sure. No, I always love to talk about that."

I mean, it's great to see the maintenance of the margins, just given the increased mix shift to the radical side of the business. But I'm curious, one, just bigger picture, does any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year, just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one? And follow up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin. So just Curious to change there, given some of the what seems like duration pressure that is hitting buildings a little bit."

You gave an example of a customer, the Fortune 100 transportation company, who cited the threat and That was a key motivator in the expansion deal.

Maybe the question that's most appropriate to start with is, why do you think this space, identity, PAM, et cetera, is just doing so much better than other areas of security? Do you feel like this is cyber specific? Do you think that identity in general is just a healthier area of security spending?

We also talked about, though, that the component parts that were downsized maybe were put into the back half of the year pipeline and were ready for expansion motion. The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect. So, I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. You know, we feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment. And, you know, I wouldn't say there's been any change in trends of a dramatic nature."

Matt, to you, on the go-to-market side, where is your priority right now? Expansion with existing customers, given the massive growth in the portfolio and what you have to offer? or going after new customers. Clearly, everyone would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your salesforce right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance, and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the three-year mark of the real big shift in subscription. So I'm kind of wondering if there's a cohort of large customers that were on three or perhaps even five-year contracts with you that are now coming for renewal. Is there a risk that they – not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted to cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they – shift from one tool to another help me understand that transition why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step downs sorry for the long question no no it's good good questions and again thanks for the support on the go-to-market side i"

And we really appreciate the bottom-line discipline that But I have a question sort of following up Etai's question on go-to-market, and it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of 23. Is there a good reason? Because people have spent a lot on security throughout 23. I guess, are you hearing this at all? And if so, Are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into 24 at the end of the year, or is budget getting pulled into 23 from 24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks."

It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow."

Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain, you know, very low across the industry and quite honestly, even within your own install base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases. In other cases, just a belief that, you know, having an EDR solution might be enough. But is there anything that Fibra can do that you think can perhaps, you know, further accelerate the adoption curve going forward?"

I think, obviously, 100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent pan for you guys. But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of, you know, legacy or best-of-breed EDR solutions. And, you know, we'd love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM. What does the profile of the customer tend to look like? Maybe the size of the customer, geo – you know, sophistication, are they more identity focused, or do you see that endpoint demand also driving demand for EPM?"

You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer."

You know, in terms of, you know, color on that, We do expect SAS to be a bigger player on the revenue side as we go into Q2 and into the second half. With regard to the investments, you know, we're catching up on some hiring, on the slower hiring from Q1, and we anticipate to continue hiring into the second half as well, and You know, so that's where we'll see some of the investment side in R&D and also, of course, in the go-to-market engine, as we always like to pre-hire when we look at multiple years of growth. You know, I think, you know, from another perspective, in terms of the mix, you know, we see the mix continuing on other than the fact that, you know, we see it kind of inching up towards some more SaaS business."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thanks, Adam. So we are, and you've all heard me talk about this opportunity of how we secure access to the cloud. And just to start with, that goes across two of the identity groups that I was describing. The traditional IT users are increasingly having to access not only on-prem targets, but also cloud assets and cloud environments. And we need what would be considered a traditional PAM tool that's able to actually manage those hybrid environments effectively or secure those hybrid environments effectively. And so our ability to be able to take SEA and blend it in within our identity security platform is a key component part of actually how we're staying ahead in securing IT users. Then there is this new population of developers out there. And these developers are hired at an exponential rate. And generally speaking, they're hired to go innovate. And once they start innovating, they're scaling up cloud environments. They have unfettered entitlements and access. And that is just not sustainable. And organizations are understanding that they need to put in place controls in the cloud. So our SCA solution, which allows for zero standing privilege, which is a unique approach, no privileges are assigned until the point of access. allows us to be able to go in and talk to customers about securing that developer population, allowing them to use native tools, and applying security controls at the point of access. So that's a way of building up then to your question, which is, all right, well, what is the differentiation here and how do these other markets play in? When you start to think about CIM, when you start to think even about ITDR, it's about really understanding or discovering what's going on. It's even in some cases about mapping entitlements versus targets. And we have a place to play in those areas, but the major place we play at CyberArk is in enforcement and in controls. And ultimately, once you discover, once you understand, you have to control. And our SCA solution is a light touch, easy to deploy, security first tool we can apply for controlling privilege access and privilege access specifically as people try to access the cloud. So that's just a little bit more background on it. I think it's an opportunity for us to be able to differentiate this cloud access market from some of the other areas that you were describing. And of course, our ability to be able to bring that into the overall platform is what sets us apart."

So on the first front when we when we look at the bookings performance in the quarter remember bookings has nothing to do with duration, so the duration we just wanted to be transparent was a bump up in the quarter it's about three and a half million of contribution around revenue. But it but it but it's not a contributing factor to the strength of our overall business, the strength of our overall business. is based upon continued growth across the entire portfolio. We continue to see AAR just grow really strongly for each piece of the platform. Now, I highlighted in the call kind of particular strength in the secrets management business, and I'm very excited by that because that, again, is showing our ability to compete effectively as a security sale in the machine identity space. So I would highlight that. I would also highlight, as we talked about earlier, our ability to be able to go back into the base and expand customers beyond PAM or securing IT into new areas like securing developers or our ability to be able to go compete effectively in the quarter around workforce and our differentiated workforce solution. So across the board, I can point to the entire portfolio, talk about strong bookings, and that kind of comes from that overall approach. Remind me again of the second question?"

One recent comment you made was you believe the browser will not only enhance security, but also drive adoption of all the other solutions. I know it's still early days, but the market seems to be moving quite fast.

And then second question for me, both for Matt as well as for Josh, is just getting an mention that over 50 percent are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your in your portfolio? And additionally, to just touch on any type of NRA type of a metric.

But it's not only Matt, the CISOs that identify that have said, hey, identity is a priority here, but it's also cyber insurance companies. I know this you and I've talked about this a lot in the past, but I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year over year for the first time in a year and a half in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique. Like you spoke about the origin of the strength of the CISOs. They've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way. But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there? Is cyber insurance, because cyber insurance, to get cyber insurance at a decent price, you have to have PAM. And is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness?"

It looks like Venify is contributing about 160 million of ARR to the full year. I'm curious.

You know, I wanted to ask a little bit about your workforce business. It's impressive to see it pass the $100 million ARR mark this quarter. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more context about how quickly that's actually growing in the base and maybe, you know, what percentage of the base is actually leveraging workforce?"
