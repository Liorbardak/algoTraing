And so as the first quarter that is chewing on some old pipeline, you can say we have some old pipeline that we expected to continue to sell as perpetual, but very pleased with how the mix is. has outperformed and very pleased with how it's looking in the current full-year Q2 and full-year pipeline. So I would say no pushback, but actually better than expected transition and really the way we wanted to start this year."

So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter."

I think we've invested the last several quarters on really integrating it to create 1 plus 1 equals 11 with being part of connected into PAM and part of the identity security portfolio. And we've also invested in putting overlay sales effort there. So we are It's still early innings for adaptive standalone, but we're seeing it, and some of the examples I've given, really play well in the cross-sell, up-sell motion with existing customers, and also as a new landing front for us, as a tip of the spear, as Matt called it, in the investor day. And so it's an early, young speedboat within CyberArk, But it's really taking off well. And, Rob, you know, on the AAR growth question, you know, we're still very much looking at 30% growth for the year on AAR. And, you know, we started off nicely on the first quarter with 41%, 30-plus percent organically, and we see that continuing through the year. All right, thanks."

And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine-month sales cycles, and we're excited about the, you know, kind of the record, continued record growth that we have in pipeline, and we'll be continuing to expand our sales teams globally. and going into each of the quarters through the second half of the year. They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year."

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SAS deal size are similar to historic perpetual deal size, which is great."

Actually, I think on the new customers, the overwhelming majority were from our core pass, and actually a large percentage of them were coming in off of our subscription and our SaaS business as well. I think 30% of, if we look even back over the whole last year, 30% of the incremental ARR that we've added has come from new customers, and, you know, probably still 90-plus percent are coming from organically. And it's important to add that many of the new packages we introduced in the year actually include adaptive components in them, like multi-factor authentication and single sign-on. So it's attached to many of the new logos. Great. Thank you."

You know, I think from, you know, really if you're talking about the accounting, you know, we talked about, you know, the headwind as it relates, you know, to our SaaS and subscription rate. For the subscription, you know, for the subscription side of the business on-prem, term-based licenses. We're looking at it going out between 50% up front, and for the new packages, it's closer to 70%. 30% upfront and 70% pro-rata over time. And on SaaS, obviously, it's fully ratable. So that goes, obviously, into the headwind calculation for the guidance. And we're pleased with the guidance to be able to, one, increase our anticipated subscription bookings mix and still really come in at what we anticipated on a revenue perspective for Q2. So from that perspective, what it really supports, and we think about it also from an annual basis, it really supports the fact that our pipeline is growing nicely. It's actually, when you think about our subscription mix and the increased headwind performance, For the quarter and for the full year, we're actually really raising our expectations for the business, you know, for the next nine months. So we're excited about what we're able to get to."

I would say we're seeing a return to normalcy on that front and the ability for us to – the pipe was building great, and I think this quarter we also showed strong execution on that pipe. And I would say that from a close rate perspective, we could probably talk about record – record close rates in this quarter. And so more and more signs of return to normal. And then, of course, the more opportunity for acceleration because we have a growing SaaS portfolio and a growing number of customers that we can take them through the SaaS journey in process."

And I think every day that goes by is another shift left day for the world and technology. Applications are growing exponentially, no matter what industry it is. So across industry, we see them becoming more and more software companies. And And we have that great bridge of securing one of the most important elements in DevSecOps, but with a win-win, transparent to the developer and a good control point for the security professionals. So we see that only becoming more and more critical, and that's why we – We, of course, put it in the speedboat, a whole speedboat behind it because of this critical opportunity."

I would say we still talk about a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but beginning to see the advantages and value, like you're talking about, of customers, of higher velocity sales, when it comes to SaaS customers and their ability to get a faster time to value and then faster adoption and our ability to push across. So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals? And we're really pleased to see the pipeline supporting that. the transition goals, meaning that we're seeing record increases in our SAS pipelines, as well as our subscription packages, including and especially our new subscription packages."

Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 versus the scenario FROM Q2 a year ago. And already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that's why, you know, we see a slight decline in the headwind, but, you know, we're still supporting the strong revenue growth. With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, You know, we're real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it's certainly happening definitely within our original goalposts of 8 to 10 quarters. We're able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple of percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think Q1 is still one quarter of work. But, you know, we'll see how Q2 goes and we'll be able to, I think, based off of the first half of the year, really reevaluate again, you know, the full transition period. But, you know, I think in order to bring it in, we'll want to see, you know, we'll want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far, we like what we see."

Udi, maybe just to start with you, it's great to see the overall revenue upside in the quarter, but I think what was really interesting was to see the revenue guide unchanged for the year despite the higher subscription mix. and sort of all the commentary on better bookings. So I was wondering if you could just maybe double-click into what you feel like is driving that underlying better bookings backdrop, because I think we heard that last quarter as well. So could you just go one level deeper into, you know, whether this is coming from a change in the competitive environment or whether this is related to maybe some of the breach activity that we've seen?

It seems like there's a lot more strategic conversations around the product portfolio. If I triangulate that to ARR, so this quarter you added $27 million in that new ARR. That was almost double versus last year in Q1. If we think about the back half, given everything that you're saying about demand environment, should we expect if demand is improving, that that net new ARR should be growing into Q2 and Q3 and Q4?

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition? And to put it bluntly, do you feel like you've given yourself enough wiggle room to really outperform like you did last year?"

So there's a lot of, you know, blurring in swim lanes with people like SailPoint, Nocta, and even HashiCorp getting into your space. But my sense is that that actually has resulted in an increase in demand for your products, as they have stimulated awareness but not necessarily impacted the share. And in fact, customers will see them come in, hear the pitch, and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the slimmed down initial versions of their products. So are we seeing a stimulation in demand for privilege access as a result of the lightweight competitive entry?"

I guess during the onset of the pandemic when you saw a little pullback in deal sizes and how the platform was being consumed, given the mix that you have now with greater SaaS mix and the greater awareness, how do you think about the durability of growth? And if we were to head into a more challenging macro environment, Where do you think you might see either benefit or risk to the durability of growth with regard to how enterprises consume the platform?"

And I only had one sentence for it, but I'm super excited about EPM for Linux because, first of all, EPM... is one of our strong performance and more than double for us along with the other SaaS solutions. And I would say from a leadership position, it's just a great, we're in a great place. But we've been addressing so far Windows endpoints and Windows servers and endpoints and Mac endpoints. And this really takes us to the Linux platforms. Both servers and there are, of course, Linux endpoints as well and really taking us into our customers' cloud environments and for those who are hybrid to their data centers and giving them that same easy to manage policies for least privilege for the Linux environment, which is so important in preventing ransomware and privilege escalation and all the, I would say, non-repeatable points of attack. So I would say it's within the huge stand that we're addressing, but we went after the Windows environments first, and the team and our channels are very excited about this, and we'll make more of a splash at our impact event. From a competitive standpoint, I talked about standalone. We have been fully partnering with the EDR vendors to date. EPM is not an EDR solution. It's an identity security solution for enforcing least privilege on the endpoint, and we think that it applies just the same as we expand to the Linux environment. But from a standalone competitive standpoint, it gives us even an additional advantage to what we have today to be able to basically cover all platforms, and again, leverage the multiple landing points we have now to also Linux."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, so thanks, Hamza. I mean, with regard to your first question, you know, we're very confident about what's going on this year. Obviously, the economy will do what the economy was doing. But I think Uri addressed it earlier on today that, you know, we have, you know, a very strong, resilient type of a business model that is basically, especially now with us hitting our subscription mix of over 85%, where we're really now driving towards going through to the other side of the transition towards growth and profitability. And when we think about this year, the demand environment has not changed, and if anything, has strengthened in the course of time. I mean, I think we saw news even this morning of pretty material events in Costa Rica. And so we're continuing to invest. However, I will point out that we're an experienced management team, and we already talked about this before. So we understand that we're constantly monitoring the situation, but at this point we're very confident on where the business is, where our pipeline is, and the demand environment around cyber. So, you know, it's still ahead. And on the second question, remind me, if it was the second question. Yeah, so I think, you know, clearly where, you know, as we get further and further into the year where the delta on the mix It gets smaller and smaller, so we have much bigger compares when we get into the second half of the year, so you're going to see a smaller growth in ARR, and we started off with a very strong growth of 48% in the first quarter. So I think that it'll go kind of in tandem with the narrowing of the headwind delta between the high 80s that we're doing in subscription business this year versus, you know, versus the 70s that we did last year. And so Q3 and Q4 will, you know, we'll have the narrowest jump. Thank you."

Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise, so I just wanted to... you know, confirmed that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level.

I mean, it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance. and the level of confidence you have to hit that and considerations you might need to make as we, you know, fine tune our model."

So is there a dynamic there where that type of architecture around zero trust is actually driving those engagements on the identity piece?

CyberArk's been a profitable company in the past.

And then that new ARR or the ARR contribution from those new ads, it seems like you're landing at a greater pace or at a greater amount for new logos. But I know you also mentioned some, I think, you know, with revenue.

But I'm curious, one, just bigger picture, does any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year, just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one? And follow up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin.

We also talked about, though, that the component parts that were downsized maybe were put into the back half of the year pipeline and were ready for expansion motion. The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect. So, I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. You know, we feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment.

And then again, with the record pipeline, any color on what you're expecting from a new logo perspective through the end of the year. Thanks."

I was hoping you could move to a little bit broader view of the world than just looking at what CyberArk is seeing and talk to us about what you're hearing from the C-suite at your customers and in the marketplace. There seems to be two specific dynamics that have set up the fear after the Fortinet print that people are cutting back on spending. Conversely, the software companies seem to be talking about an improved normalization and stability. So what are you seeing from the aggregate C-suite about what their intentions are on overall spending on security? Thanks."

I guess I'm curious with the existing customers, how much emphasis are you putting on the cross-sell motion know take the conversions out of it you've talked about building those road maps with with those perpetual customers to migrate them potentially with multiple products but if you look at your existing you know subscription customers what kind of expansion rates are you seeing with that installed base and how much emphasis are you placing on the cross-sell motion yeah no i i think it's the uh you know at some level the backbone of our growth story you know we still see"

Matt, to you, on the go-to-market side, where is your priority right now? Expansion with existing customers, given the massive growth in the portfolio and what you have to offer? or going after new customers. Clearly, everyone would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your salesforce right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance, and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the three-year mark of the real big shift in subscription. So I'm kind of wondering if there's a cohort of large customers that were on three or perhaps even five-year contracts with you that are now coming for renewal. Is there a risk that they – not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted to cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they – shift from one tool to another help me understand that transition why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step downs sorry for the long question no no it's good good questions and again thanks for the support on the go-to-market side i"

Or is SaaS going to continue to be more of a, I guess, larger enterprise opportunity with the ability to drive easier and more cost-effective adoption?"

Guys, you continue to put up impressive top-line momentum in an environment when, frankly, most aren't, even in the security segment. And we really appreciate the bottom-line discipline that But I have a question sort of following up Etai's question on go-to-market, and it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of 23. Is there a good reason? Because people have spent a lot on security throughout 23. I guess, are you hearing this at all? And if so, Are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into 24 at the end of the year, or is budget getting pulled into 23 from 24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks."

It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow."

Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain, you know, very low across the industry and quite honestly, even within your own install base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases. In other cases, just a belief that, you know, having an EDR solution might be enough. But is there anything that Fibra can do that you think can perhaps, you know, further accelerate the adoption curve going forward?"

I think, obviously, 100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent pan for you guys. But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of, you know, legacy or best-of-breed EDR solutions. And, you know, we'd love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM. What does the profile of the customer tend to look like? Maybe the size of the customer, geo – you know, sophistication, are they more identity focused, or do you see that endpoint demand also driving demand for EPM?"

You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there."

Awesome to see the cash flow machine turn on. It was impressive operating margin performance this quarter and the guidance, although the full year raise was modestly less than the beat. Can you just walk us through the dynamics for this year? Is that primarily rev mix shifts? I think you mentioned headcount growth, but moderating. So just any other investments we should think through, given, you know, the 34% ARR growth is highly indicative of a large opportunity. Thanks."

And Matt, going back to the point you mentioned to the question of EPM being complementary to EDR, it is complementary today, but clearly more and more of your portfolio right now is at the edge. I would think the browser, I would think about that as an edge product as well. And so as you're moving closer and closer to the edge, can your EPM product evolve into an EDR-like product and be competitive with an EDR solution?"

First of all, in that, you're prepared and worked, you called out some nice wins. And I just wanted to double double click on those and try to understand that or I guess confirm with you that second quarter was really driven by a host of different deals versus one or two really oversized large ones. And then second question for me, both for Matt as well as for Josh, is just getting an mention that over 50 percent are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your in your portfolio? And additionally, to just touch on any type of NRA type of a metric. I know last time you spoke, I think it was still trending above one twenty five. So we could just kind of get an indication of where it is now. That'd"

And in that, you know, you're you're coming in at the tail end of earnings and your call sounds quite different than pretty much what we've heard out there. And so I want to drill down a little bit into that relative to is there a sense of urgency you're finding from companies or customers? Excuse me. I mean, your new logo counts up. Few companies have had the the net new ARR growth in the first half that you guys have. So is it just all coming together at this point? Or is there is there some sense of urgency? Because the economy has been relatively uneven or flat at best for most."

But it's not only Matt, the CISOs that identify that have said, hey, identity is a priority here, but it's also cyber insurance companies. I know this you and I've talked about this a lot in the past, but I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year over year for the first time in a year and a half in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique. Like you spoke about the origin of the strength of the CISOs. They've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way. But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there? Is cyber insurance, because cyber insurance, to get cyber insurance at a decent price, you have to have PAM. And is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness?"

I know you guys talk a lot about how your workforce product portfolio is differentiated because, you know, you have some adjacent offerings that just makes .S.O. and MFA feel more secure. But can you talk to some of the strategic pricing initiatives you're taking that help make customers not only feel like the product portfolio is differentiated, but they're just getting much more value from it as well and how that's maybe helped driving those improving win rates?"

So I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail or maybe a taste of what maybe some of these anticipatory investments or plans or efforts or initiatives might be around benefit, you know, provided that hasn't closed yet.

Matt, high-level question around post-quantum. It seems like awareness is raising there. I'm wondering, based off your conversations with customers, do you think that we're getting into the actual adoption curve where customers are looking to pick up post-quantum security tools, some of the stuff you're talking about with being able to gauge exposure and get to a place of certificate agility there? And now with Venify and the platform, is there any sense of how material you think this could be as a driver in the next year? And then I have a quick follow-up."

You talked about the platform selling approach being great traction, especially with some of the wins you talked about. Now, I'm just curious maybe from a technology perspective under the hood, especially as we now fold in Medify, how do we think about how – integrated, as we call it, the human side of the portfolio is today. You talked about efforts to integrate secrets and Venify. And how should I think about almost a converged human slash non-human identity portfolio on the back end in coming years? Thanks so much."

I have been called Don before, but anyway, Mike, I don't mean to beat a dead horse on this, but really, I think I'm curious, like why Venify represents an incremental growth plan for you? Matt, you talked about the go-to-market push, and that makes some sense. And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here. And you guys have executed really well, and that's part of it too, right? That's positive. But I don't know, if you could speak a little bit to that. I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere."
