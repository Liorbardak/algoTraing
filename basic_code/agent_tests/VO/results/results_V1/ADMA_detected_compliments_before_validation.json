And then specific to Bibigam, just to give us a sense maybe of sort of what changed here in the third quarter, you know, was it share gains in new infusion centers, or was it just excess purchasing from existing sites?

Substantially, we've already sold the majority of the 2200 to date.

Maybe, Adam, to start, we can talk a little bit just about hyperimmune globulin specifically. Certainly, there's momentum and incentive here. Your prepared remarks point towards stickiness, but also continued new patient volumes for incentive. And then your competitor and supplier, Griffles, also reported a very strong hyperimmune globulin number for their quarter and one Q of 23. So maybe just to level set us a little bit here on the state of hyperimmune globulins, And then specific to ADMA, just the tailwinds we're seeing in Ascentive, how sustainable is the momentum in new patient starts? And over time, how sticky can this prove to be on those patients as we continue to move ahead here? And then I'll have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks."

Let me also add my congratulations to you on another great quarter and the pattern that we've really seen emerge over the last couple quarters here. So I wanted to ask you a bit more on incentive utilization. If I look at some of your publications, posters, et cetera, it really seems that the benefits are quite broad. I mean, the age of the patients, the underlying comorbidities, the time to treatment, it seems pretty diverse amongst the patients yet the benefits are all there. So curious if real time you're seeing that the effects represent a broad patient population or if there's a specific type that you've seen. And then can you talk about some of your plans maybe the next 12 months to collect and report on more of these case studies?"

Now, I think six quarters of a beaten race, so it's great to see, and congratulations to the team. Maybe, Adam, we hosted an immunologist call a few weeks ago just exploring the use case for Ascentive, And a few interesting data points come out of that call. One is that in particular in this individual's practice, they are actually seeing, you know, benefits in these patients where, you know, they were quote unquote refractory to traditional immunoglobulins. So maybe from the company standpoint and anecdotally, when you think about these complex immune deficient patients that are susceptible to, you know, follow on respiratory infections, They're complex. They're not responding to immunoglobulins. You know, what are you hearing from a broader set of your immunologists that are treating these patients? So that would be the first question. And the second question is, you know, one of the data points that came out of that call is, you know, perhaps there needs to be more physician education around the benefits of Ascentive. in order to unlock really having this product reach more of these complex patients. And so what is the sort of go-to-market strategy here now that Ascentiv is sort of becoming a go-to solution here? Are you increasing the sales efforts to reach more of these patients? And I'll have a follow-up for Brian. Thanks."

So just given that you've continued to showcase your data and findings and just the word of mouth around these positive case studies, Wanted to ask how much of the treating community you estimate is aware of the added benefits that Ascentive is showing here?

And the first thought in my head is, you know, are they paying attention yet to the performance here? But in looking ahead, I think one of the questions that we get, you know, from folks out there, and it seems like you touched on it, is, is where we are. And I think the, you know, the capacity utilization today of the business with the center of growing, you know, much faster than expected and ViviGam certainly looking like it's gaining steady market share in the, in the traditional IG market. So maybe just a little bit on where capacity utilization is today. And you spoke a little bit about the peak potential of this business. You know, you look at the guidance you put out there for 24 and 25 and When we do our math, there's a lot of room for variability, but we get to a number that's quite a bit higher than your 2025 number.

I have no idea if it's fabricated or not, but you can't walk into a store and buy one. I mean, incentive is all allocated out there. New patient starts are scheduled.

To start, we're counting now six consecutive quarters here of a beaten raise, Adam, and we're at the midpoint of 2024, and the company's been good in updating the two-year forward outlook for 2024 and 2025. If we back out the accrual of $12 million in the quarter, that base top-line rate is growing 58%. You're obviously levering the P&L to higher profitability levels.

And then just on the operating leverage, you know, it's really incredible what you're able to do keeping the expenses in check. But with the penetration of the Senate still less than 3%, it begs the question if it makes sense to invest more, or do you have to first, you know, wait to have enough supply before you would spend more in sales and marketing, if that's a consideration?"
