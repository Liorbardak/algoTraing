So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter."

And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine-month sales cycles, and we're excited about the, you know, kind of the record, continued record growth that we have in pipeline, and we'll be continuing to expand our sales teams globally. and going into each of the quarters through the second half of the year. They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year."

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SAS deal size are similar to historic perpetual deal size, which is great."

So across industry, we see them becoming more and more software companies. And And we have that great bridge of securing one of the most important elements in DevSecOps, but with a win-win, transparent to the developer and a good control point for the security professionals. So we see that only becoming more and more critical, and that's why we – We, of course, put it in the speedboat, a whole speedboat behind it because of this critical opportunity."

I would say we still talk about a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but beginning to see the advantages and value, like you're talking about, of customers, of higher velocity sales, when it comes to SaaS customers and their ability to get a faster time to value and then faster adoption and our ability to push across. So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals? And we're really pleased to see the pipeline supporting that. the transition goals, meaning that we're seeing record increases in our SAS pipelines, as well as our subscription packages, including and especially our new subscription packages."

Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 versus the scenario FROM Q2 a year ago. And already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that's why, you know, we see a slight decline in the headwind, but, you know, we're still supporting the strong revenue growth. With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, You know, we're real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it's certainly happening definitely within our original goalposts of 8 to 10 quarters. We're able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple of percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think Q1 is still one quarter of work. But, you know, we'll see how Q2 goes and we'll be able to, I think, based off of the first half of the year, really reevaluate again, you know, the full transition period. But, you know, I think in order to bring it in, we'll want to see, you know, we'll want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far, we like what we see."

And for you, Josh, just want to make sure on your guidance for the year, you know, with inflation all around, are there any price increases that you're implementing? And if so, how have they been worked into the guide? Thanks."

So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, and not in the way that I think most people are thinking about it. So there's a lot of, you know, blurring in swim lanes with people like SailPoint, Nocta, and even HashiCorp getting into your space. But my sense is that that actually has resulted in an increase in demand for your products, as they have stimulated awareness but not necessarily impacted the share. And in fact, customers will see them come in, hear the pitch, and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the slimmed down initial versions of their products. So are we seeing a stimulation in demand for privilege access as a result of the lightweight competitive entry?"

Udi, some security and broader software vendors who have recently reported earnings have spoken about longer sales cycles among larger enterprise customers. Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise, so I just wanted to... you know, confirmed that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level.

As we think about the guidance and the setup for the back half of the year, how do you think about seasonality, perhaps a mix of term and SAS in there, and how do we get confidence? I mean, it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance. and the level of confidence you have to hit that and considerations you might need to make as we, you know, fine tune our model."

Can you talk to us about what you see within the machine identity now?

But I'm curious, one, just bigger picture, does any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year, just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one? And follow up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin. So just Curious to change there, given some of the what seems like duration pressure that is hitting buildings a little bit."

You gave an example of a customer, the Fortune 100 transportation company, who cited the threat and That was a key motivator in the expansion deal.

You've talked about 50%, 60% landing with two-plus products. I guess I'm curious with the existing customers, how much emphasis are you putting on the cross-sell motion know take the conversions out of it you've talked about building those road maps with with those perpetual customers to migrate them potentially with multiple products but if you look at your existing you know subscription customers what kind of expansion rates are you seeing with that installed base and how much emphasis are you placing on the cross-sell motion yeah no i i think it's the uh you know at some level the backbone of our growth story you know we still see\n\nBy the way, strong upsell of Pam seats. They own some and they're expanding to more. And as more users become privileged, they need to expand out. But I would tell you that the sales team is eating their dinners off of the cross-sell motion because it is the compelling story in the market. It's the compelling story of our identity security platform. Hey, you know, you're protecting IT. Protect the workforce. You're protecting the on-prem environment. Protect the cloud. Protect the hybrid and lift and shift environments. You're doing human. Now you need to start doing non-human or machine identities. So I would tell you that we are thrilled, I would use that word, with our expansion selling capabilities, our expansion selling performance. And I think that's what sets us up for such a strong future. I think at our investor day, we talked about an $8 billion TAM within our install base. And those motions, to be honest, are easier than going and landing a new logo. And so when we have that kind of well lubricated and working, the growth story really takes off. from the base."

Matt, to you, on the go-to-market side, where is your priority right now? Expansion with existing customers, given the massive growth in the portfolio and what you have to offer? or going after new customers. Clearly, everyone would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your salesforce right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance, and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the three-year mark of the real big shift in subscription. So I'm kind of wondering if there's a cohort of large customers that were on three or perhaps even five-year contracts with you that are now coming for renewal. Is there a risk that they – not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted to cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they – shift from one tool to another help me understand that transition why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step downs sorry for the long question no no it's good good questions and again thanks for the support on the go-to-market side i"

Guys, you continue to put up impressive top-line momentum in an environment when, frankly, most aren't, even in the security segment. And we really appreciate the bottom-line discipline that But I have a question sort of following up Etai's question on go-to-market, and it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of 23. Is there a good reason? Because people have spent a lot on security throughout 23. I guess, are you hearing this at all? And if so, Are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into 24 at the end of the year, or is budget getting pulled into 23 from 24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks."

Maybe building on that journey, you just put out a press release on Indiana University Hospital, expanding relations with CyberArk. Maybe a good opportunity here to share with us what is it that they're doing with CyberRock on top of their core PAM deployment, and where else can they expand with you guys in the coming years? And I have a follow-up."

Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain, you know, very low across the industry and quite honestly, even within your own install base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases. In other cases, just a belief that, you know, having an EDR solution might be enough. But is there anything that Fibra can do that you think can perhaps, you know, further accelerate the adoption curve going forward?"

I think, obviously, 100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent pan for you guys. But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of, you know, legacy or best-of-breed EDR solutions. And, you know, we'd love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM. What does the profile of the customer tend to look like? Maybe the size of the customer, geo – you know, sophistication, are they more identity focused, or do you see that endpoint demand also driving demand for EPM?"

Matt, in your prepared remarks, you shared a lot of anecdotes about customers who are increasingly landing with a higher incidence of products across the portfolio. So when I internalize this as manifesting in maybe increased wallet share, Can you talk to us a little bit about the expansion rates and the dollar-based retention rates that you're realizing in the portfolio? And, you know, specifically in contrast to maybe some of the newer logo activity that relative to more recent quarters was a little bit slower. So just that compare and contrast between the momentum and the size and scope of the momentum within the install base versus the new logo activity in the quarter. Thank you."

Awesome to see the cash flow machine turn on. It was impressive operating margin performance this quarter and the guidance, although the full year raise was modestly less than the beat. Can you just walk us through the dynamics for this year? Is that primarily rev mix shifts? I think you mentioned headcount growth, but moderating. So just any other investments we should think through, given, you know, the 34% ARR growth is highly indicative of a large opportunity. Thanks."

I actually thought the guidance raised was better than expected in light of what we're seeing, I think, in software. More broadly, I'm curious, you know, it's Q1. It tends to be the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, and it's early in the year. So, you know, what's giving you confidence to raise that ARR guide? by the magnitude that you did, given what's still somewhat uncertain macro environment. Thank you."

First of all, in that, you're prepared and worked, you called out some nice wins. And I just wanted to double double click on those and try to understand that or I guess confirm with you that second quarter was really driven by a host of different deals versus one or two really oversized large ones. And then second question for me, both for Matt as well as for Josh, is just getting an mention that over 50 percent are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your in your portfolio? And additionally, to just touch on any type of NRA type of a metric. I know last time you spoke, I think it was still trending above one twenty five. So we could just kind of get an indication of where it is now. That'd"

And so I want to drill down a little bit into that relative to is there a sense of urgency you're finding from companies or customers? Excuse me. I mean, your new logo counts up. Few companies have had the the net new ARR growth in the first half that you guys have. So is it just all coming together at this point? Or is there is there some sense of urgency? Because the economy has been relatively uneven or flat at best for most."

But it's not only Matt, the CISOs that identify that have said, hey, identity is a priority here, but it's also cyber insurance companies. I know this you and I've talked about this a lot in the past, but I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year over year for the first time in a year and a half in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique. Like you spoke about the origin of the strength of the CISOs. They've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way. But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there? Is cyber insurance, because cyber insurance, to get cyber insurance at a decent price, you have to have PAM. And is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness?"

I know you guys talk a lot about how your workforce product portfolio is differentiated because, you know, you have some adjacent offerings that just makes .S.O. and MFA feel more secure. But can you talk to some of the strategic pricing initiatives you're taking that help make customers not only feel like the product portfolio is differentiated, but they're just getting much more value from it as well and how that's maybe helped driving those improving win rates?"

So I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail or maybe a taste of what maybe some of these anticipatory investments or plans or efforts or initiatives might be around benefit, you know, provided that hasn't closed yet.
