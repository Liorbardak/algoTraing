REVISED PROMPT:

This is an explanation text, and at the end of the explanation, there will be an earnings call transcript. Analyze the following earnings call transcript and extract only the sentences where analysts compliment the company’s performance during the quarter. 

Compliments may not always be explicit and may not always include the words 'congratulations' or 'congrats'. They can be phrases that express positive feedback on results or execution, such as:
   •   “Congrats on a great quarter”
   •   “Congratulations on the strong results”
   •   “Great to see the execution”
   •   “Very good job in the quarter”
   •   "Strong performance"
   •   "Good quarter"
   •   "Great quarter"
   •   "Good job on the quarter"
   •   "Strong execution"
   •   "Nice performance this quarter"
   •   "Impressive results"
   •   "Very strong quarter"
   •   "Another home run quarter"

Only include compliments that relate specifically to the company’s financial performance or operational execution during the reported quarter.

Exclude any congratulatory messages that relate to:
   •   Personal events (e.g. retirement, promotions, new roles)
   •   Mergers, acquisitions, or strategic announcements not related to performance this quarter
   •   General greetings or non-performance topics

Make sure that all the analysts are written, both the analysts who gave compliments and those who did not compliment.
Make sure that every analyst appears in the file exactly once. If the same analyst asked several questions you should count him only once. 

After identifying all compliments (if any), please put them in a JSON structure with the following fields:

- analyst_name: The name of the analyst
- level: 1 if the analyst gave a compliment, 0 otherwise
- quoted_compliment: copy the paragraph that contains the compliment exactly as it is written in the text. in case the analyst didn't give a compliment, put ''.

Your response should include only JSON format with the above fields that can be loaded using json.loads(), without any further text.
