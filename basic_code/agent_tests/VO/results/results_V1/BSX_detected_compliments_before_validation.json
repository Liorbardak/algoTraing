                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. We're not concerned at all about the cost cutting and its ability to impact our competitiveness. We actually think it's smart. It's the rational cuts and our employees support it. So we have reduced down some of the inventory builds because we don't want to stack up too much inventory, which makes sense from a cashflow perspective. But we're very mindful of the need for surge capacity. So we ensure that we have ample supply, which we're very comfortable with based on the tracking that we do and the agility of our operations team. So we're doing this with a mindset that we're going to have a stronger recovery as the months move on here in second quarter and third quarter. And we're highly comfortable with ample supply, which is the most important one. Secondly, many of the actions that we've taken, actually we've led in this area, has been to secure our very important sales team. So we won't give the details there. We've ensured certain levels of compensation for our sales teams, despite the significant sales misses that are occurring. So we feel like we've built strong loyalty and support from our sales team by taking those actions earlier than most. And also we have moved to a four-day work week. And the goal for that would be for it to be a second quarter impact only, but we'll see how that progresses as the recovery returns. And quite frankly, that's been met pretty well with our employee base. They're highly engaged, they're working very effectively from home. We're building new capabilities in digital and it's really a one-team approach. And also with the support of the CARES Act, some of those employees are also benefiting from some of the financial relief in certain states in that area. So actually we think all the actions are what smart companies would do. And if anything, I think it's built potentially greater loyalty amongst our employee base within changes we've made."

I think it'll be helpful for all of us for the rest of earnings. Maybe turning to my question, a big part of the Boston scientific story has always been the pipeline. And that's obviously hit a bump here is running trials is pretty difficult. You pulled the future product launch page. Hopefully it'll come back once you could get trials restarted. But how were you thinking internally about the delays to new product launches and something that was in the pipeline that had a trial involved with it?"

And then my second question is, I'm looking generally in life right now for silver linings. So during this period of time, what are you learning either about your business or your employees that help you on the other side? Maybe it's telemedicine, maybe it's expenses, maybe it's something else, thank you."

April, May, June, some of the businesses were down farther in April and faster back in June, like Neuromod. But we're encouraged by the overall IC improvement trend, April, May, June, and consistent with all our businesses, nice improvement in July. Within Structural Heart, we didn't break out each month within the product categories, but Watchman did have a larger impact in the trough in April. But we've seen a very nice consistent recovery, as I mentioned in the script, throughout the second quarter. and also a very nice improvement in July. So really encouraged about the watchman momentum that we're seeing. And as I mentioned before, the TAVR new openings were impacted more significantly in the second quarter. So we are starting to see the gates open up a bit more in terms of new account openings with Lotus, and we're going to be launching the Accurate Neo2 device in Europe in the second half. So we have seen improvement. Again, our structural heart portfolio, particularly in June and July from second quarter. On the portfolio side, we've got some important launches, obviously, with Accurate NEO2 scheduled to launch in Europe in the second half. We're excited about that. Sentinel continues to perform very well. And we continue to enroll in the U.S. on our intermediate risk trial with Lotus, as well as our U.S. trial with AccurateNeo2. But obviously the most exciting thing for us is the next generation Watchman device, which recently was approved. It has excellent clinical data. It was our fastest enrolling trial that we've ever had as a company. And we'll begin our LME, our initial launch, very quickly here. We expect to go to a full launch mode in fourth quarter. So kudos to the team for excellent engineering with that. Our clinical team did a great job on the trial, and we're very bullish on the future of our Watchman franchise with a second generation, which we expect to be in the market likely a year or potentially more prior to the next generation competitor coming."

So first on Watchman, you know, one of the things investors are paying attention to is, you know, potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the most from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the Watchman business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there. And I'll just ask my second now. On Exalt-B, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be. But, you know, hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much."

I mean, we're already running, if I look at the 2Q to 4Q performance, we're already running well north of 8%.

Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good."

So what I'm curious about is what you're seeing in non COVID geographies, as far as the momentum in those businesses, You know, are you taking share with some of these new products? Are you seeing accelerating momentum with some of these new categories?

I made a few comments before that, first of all, Watchman, the clinical results for Watchman Flex are extraordinarily good. And doctors have tremendous confidence in the platform, and they've been using it for about a year. And your average doctor is increasing their utilization of Watchmen every quarter because of the confidence that they have. And the referring physician community is seeing their patients recover and get off blood thinners and reduce the risk of stroke. So it's expanding the awareness in the referring physician community, the GI community, the neuro community. So there's a lot of momentum there. And the other important thing I mentioned, that productivity, even in COVID, You have hospitals dramatically moving watchmen, limiting anesthesia, using ice imaging, and doing procedures that are very, very efficient, in many cases less than an hour. And the economics of watchmen now are quite good across the U.S. So there's, you know, there's always headwinds and tailwinds across a diversified portfolio, but the tailwinds from reimbursement, procedural efficiency, Clinical outcomes, new clinical data, product cadence are very, very positive with Watchman."

                "quoted_compliment": "Sure. I've been in the field a lot recently, and it is an issue for hospital CEOs. There's no doubt about it. They've had to increase their wages and labor force expenses to accommodate increasing wages for nurses and staff and so forth. So they're working through that process. But it's not going to be a short-term issue, but hospitals are pretty resilient. And as you know, a couple things I would say that point specific to BSE and how that's changing is just the use of telehealth and telemedicine and prescreening for patients has become, you know, very widespread and very efficient. So that reduces down significantly the number of patient visits to the hospital, drives more efficiency and staff productivity. So I think you're going to continue to see that trend, you know, continue to increase. Another one more specific to Boston is what I mentioned before is, you know, we're not a surgery company. So we're not driving multi-day length of stays in a hospital. The portfolio shift, the shift to interventional medicine is helpful for hospitals. And it gets patients in and out of the clinic or outpatient setting typically in the same day. And you see more of our complex procedures because of the capabilities and the technology we have augmented by imaging move to more outpatient settings. And I made the comment on Watchmen how that mix shift has moved more and more to same-day procedures. So I think a combination of telehealth, a combination of outpatient orientation and same-day procedures is very helpful for our product mix. And hospitals, just like anybody else, they innovate and they find a way. So it is a headwind. But it's, you know, in the quarter here where we had staffing shortages and its surge, we grew okay. And I think the surges will calm and the staffing shortage will likely linger a bit. But hospitals are pretty resilient in figuring out ways to drive volume."

You know, our PI business has been very resilient consistently. Drives consistent high performance. We're the number one DCB player now in Japan. The team's done a great job with that launch. And the TheraSphere platform continues to do extremely well. And you saw that clinical data. So, you know, that division continues to do very well. Endo, I would put him despite COVID, grew 8% versus 19 in the quarter. And a number of new product launches. Euro has been impacted by COVID, but That typically bounces back when COVID improves. And we've got a lot of commentary and watchmen today. We saw strong EP growth in Europe. We continue to lag in the U.S., but the EP momentum we see in Europe and Japan is very encouraging based on our cryo capabilities as well as the early insights into FerriPulse. I don't know if I answered your question, but... I'm actually, as I said in the call, I'm really pleased with the quarter given the macro headwinds that the company faced."

So if you look at cardiology and you look at peripheral, you look at cardiac rhythm management, those have held on and we're actually getting pretty good at this now at the number of waves we've had relative to COVID. Those are much more emergent and hold up better. Mike mentioned this earlier that businesses like neuromodulation and urology, they come down very quickly in a COVID wave. The good news is they come back very quickly. So it's kind of a V-shaped curve for those businesses. They obviously don't perform as well in a COVID setting, but they come back very nicely on the other side. So there's not really one number you can point to for the whole company and pinpoint it. It varies by business. But I think we've proven and have a good track record in a non-COVID environment that the business performs very well. And as Mike's comments preclude, that's what we're looking forward to in 22 and beyond."

Fourth quarter continues to look good in guidance. I think the one area where we're seeing a little pressure is on margins. So, Dan, I was hoping you might be able to give us an early look into next year. How elevated is the spending? There's a lot of moving pieces with OpEx and currency and the share count. You know, do you think the street's generally in a decent spot for next year with returning to more normalized margin expansion, or do you think it's still going to be a pressured year in 2023?

So I'm just curious, You know, if you feel like that momentum is going to continue into 23 where you can stay one of the faster growth large cap med tech names out there, and if it's going to be more of a broad-based, you know, level of improvement across all the different franchises where you can keep kind of growing in this double-digit range in some areas, or if it's going to be a little bit more focal than what we've seen historically.

And I guess I'm thankful that I've got about six months to get to know this humorous side that everyone's referring to. So I look forward to that. Just one follow-up, if I could, on margins. Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the three-cent reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. There's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative, just given the strengths, but love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 23, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 23 some of the higher costs will go and If we were to think about, is that sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 23 at this point, or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on.

But anything you can share now, and then also just on cash, if I could, you know, you have so many things going on in the portfolio and in your clinical programs, but I'd love to get your sort of posture on the business development front and in your efforts to find and invest in additional technology and assets.

Dr. Stein, on Advent, just using the same definition of success in Advent as manifest, I think the success rate was 74%.

And separately, what have the success rates been with RF and cryo in previous studies when using the same criteria as ADVENT? And sorry for the long question.

And I believe one of the comments was at the beginning of the range, it'll be towards the lower end and accelerate as you have some of your big new product launches coming.

Neutral, again, a little up, a little down. On the cost side, kind of where are you seeing opportunities, raw materials, freight labor? Where are you seeing tensions?

Can you just give us a little more sense for, because I think those two collectively were roughly after growth this quarter. The durability of the performance in those geographies, is it a function of just more and more products into those areas? And so, you know, that's pretty straightforward. Or is it share taking that's required or what's really required to continue to deliver? Maybe not this level of growth, which is really strong again, but a very strong growth going forward where that's, you know, a significant contributor to the top line for 24, 25 and beyond. Thanks."

I'm guessing, you know, having just played with the numbers, and correct me if I'm wrong, but there's some assumption of slightly faster growth there.

For my one question, I wanted to look at some of the, I'll call them legacy businesses. Not sure if that's fair to describe them, maybe slower growth businesses. I mean, a CRM mid-single-digit growth is very strong. Interventional cardiology of double digits, very strong. Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in interventional cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stem portfolio, obviously, and then CRM. Can they sustain these kinds of growth profiles, given that the end markets are, from a volume perspective, are arguably probably some of your slower growth end markets? And what needs to happen from an innovation perspective to sustain that sort of growth? Thanks so much."

You talked a little bit about the importance of mapping and access, but how should we think about the portfolio evolving and how that unlocks new opportunities for you, whether that's in the non-AF side of the ablation market, be it with FerroPoint or some of the other products. And then on the commercial side, where are the opportunities for pull-through here? So, for example, are you training your mappers on generator replacements and ICDs?

Wanted to just get a sense of of taking some of that profitability and reinvesting that, you know, where could we see, where's some of those dollars going, and just some high-level commentary on that reinvestment driving, supporting this sustainability of top-tier revenue growth in the medtech space.

You know, your competitor said they grew 45% in the quarter. So are you losing a little bit of share to those guys, or is the market starting to accelerate for some reason? I don't know if it's in front of this concomitant reimbursement. Just, you know, maybe talk a little bit about that. And then maybe for Dr. Stein specifically, if you get this concomitant reimbursement, can you just talk about the workflow for the clinician in terms of doing a PFA case plus a Watchman reimbursement? case at the same time. I mean, how much more challenging is that? Do you have to bring in an IC sometimes and other times not bring an IC in to do the watchman part of the case?

Make it a good one, Robby. In our checks, we hear consistently that the upcoming option trial that we'll see at AHA combined with the recently started on October 1st, reimbursement for concomitant, watchman, and ablation, has already started to kick into gear, and option could meaningfully alter the usage patterns ahead of Champion in the first half of 26.

Obviously, I get PFA adding some efficiencies to the system overall, but for EPs, between Watchmen and everything, there's a tremendous call on people's time. We saw on Structural Heart a little bit of noise from one of the players saying there were capacity constraints. How are you viewing that going forward, and how quickly do you think the system can adapt to enable you to keep growing these franchises that still have capacity to actually get them done? Thanks."

So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year and presumably we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach So maybe the question here is just when we enter 25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers.

And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter, but I wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment.

And then if you can't comment on that, is there anything to think about in terms of this patient population really being the cause of the difference, maybe extra lesions that need to be created? um, higher risk, you know, benefit requirements because it's drug naive patients.
