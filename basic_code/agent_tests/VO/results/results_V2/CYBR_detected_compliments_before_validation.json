And so as the first quarter that is chewing on some old pipeline, you can say we have some old pipeline that we expected to continue to sell as perpetual, but very pleased with how the mix is. has outperformed and very pleased with how it's looking in the current full-year Q2 and full-year pipeline. So I would say no pushback, but actually better than expected transition and really the way we wanted to start this year."

So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter."

I think we've invested the last several quarters on really integrating it to create 1 plus 1 equals 11 with being part of connected into PAM and part of the identity security portfolio. And we've also invested in putting overlay sales effort there. So we are It's still early innings for adaptive standalone, but we're seeing it, and some of the examples I've given, really play well in the cross-sell, up-sell motion with existing customers, and also as a new landing front for us, as a tip of the spear, as Matt called it, in the investor day. And so it's an early, young speedboat within CyberArk, But it's really taking off well. And, Rob, you know, on the AAR growth question, you know, we're still very much looking at 30% growth for the year on AAR. And, you know, we started off nicely on the first quarter with 41%, 30-plus percent organically, and we see that continuing through the year. All right, thanks."

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SAS deal size are similar to historic perpetual deal size, which is great."

I would say we're seeing a return to normalcy on that front and the ability for us to – the pipe was building great, and I think this quarter we also showed strong execution on that pipe. And I would say that from a close rate perspective, we could probably talk about record – record close rates in this quarter. And so more and more signs of return to normal. And then, of course, the more opportunity for acceleration because we have a growing SaaS portfolio and a growing number of customers that we can take them through the SaaS journey in process."

I would say we still talk about a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but beginning to see the advantages and value, like you're talking about, of customers, of higher velocity sales, when it comes to SaaS customers and their ability to get a faster time to value and then faster adoption and our ability to push across. So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals? And we're really pleased to see the pipeline supporting that. the transition goals, meaning that we're seeing record increases in our SAS pipelines, as well as our subscription packages, including and especially our new subscription packages."

Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 versus the scenario FROM Q2 a year ago. And already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that's why, you know, we see a slight decline in the headwind, but, you know, we're still supporting the strong revenue growth. With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, You know, we're real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it's certainly happening definitely within our original goalposts of 8 to 10 quarters. We're able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple of percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think Q1 is still one quarter of work. But, you know, we'll see how Q2 goes and we'll be able to, I think, based off of the first half of the year, really reevaluate again, you know, the full transition period. But, you know, I think in order to bring it in, we'll want to see, you know, we'll want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far, we like what we see."

And I think every day that goes by is another shift left day for the world and technology. Applications are growing exponentially, no matter what industry it is. So across industry, we see them becoming more and more software companies. And And we have that great bridge of securing one of the most important elements in DevSecOps, but with a win-win, transparent to the developer and a good control point for the security professionals. So we see that only becoming more and more critical, and that's why we – We, of course, put it in the speedboat, a whole speedboat behind it because of this critical opportunity."

Udi, maybe just to start with you, it's great to see the overall revenue upside in the quarter, but I think what was really interesting was to see the revenue guide unchanged for the year despite the higher subscription mix. and sort of all the commentary on better bookings. So I was wondering if you could just maybe double-click into what you feel like is driving that underlying better bookings backdrop, because I think we heard that last quarter as well. So could you just go one level deeper into, you know, whether this is coming from a change in the competitive environment or whether this is related to maybe some of the breach activity that we've seen? Curious what you feel like is driving that better bookings activity."

It seems like there's a lot more strategic conversations around the product portfolio. If I triangulate that to ARR, so this quarter you added $27 million in that new ARR. That was almost double versus last year in Q1. If we think about the back half, given everything that you're saying about demand environment, should we expect if demand is improving, that that net new ARR should be growing into Q2 and Q3 and Q4?

Obviously, that process continues out into 22, and I know you don't give guidance for 22, but the street has a significant increase in EPS model for 22, yet I think your slide deck from your analyst day showed a decline in operating margins from 21 to 22. Is a decline in operating margins still in order given the the accelerated pace that you've already achieved, or alternatively, will that moderate a little bit more because you're already further into the process? If you could give us some directionality to margins for 22, based on your expectations around the transition achieving 85, excuse me, the 85% by the end of the year, fourth quarter, that would be very helpful.

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition? And to put it bluntly, do you feel like you've given yourself enough wiggle room to really outperform like you did last year?"

So there's a lot of, you know, blurring in swim lanes with people like SailPoint, Nocta, and even HashiCorp getting into your space. But my sense is that that actually has resulted in an increase in demand for your products, as they have stimulated awareness but not necessarily impacted the share. And in fact, customers will see them come in, hear the pitch, and then realize they need the technology and therefore come to you as opposed to going with the slimmed down initial versions of their products. So are we seeing a stimulation in demand for privilege access as a result of the lightweight competitive entry?"

Udi, some security and broader software vendors who have recently reported earnings have spoken about longer sales cycles among larger enterprise customers. Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise, so I just wanted to... you know, confirmed that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level.

I mean, it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance. and the level of confidence you have to hit that and considerations you might need to make as we, you know, fine tune our model."

Udi, you had a brief mention of Zero Trust as being an influencer and was wondering if you could maybe give a little color around how that influenced the strong performance, if at all, as far as new customer logos in 230 or so for the quarter, which was we thought was strong. So is there a dynamic there where that type of architecture around zero trust is actually driving those engagements on the identity piece? Or is that more maybe current PAM customers coming in and looking to support their zero trust plans with what they've already got going with you guys? I guess, how are those engagements happening on that zero trust front?"

CyberArk's been a profitable company in the past. But just given the opportunity that you're seeing and the success that you're seeing in multiple identity categories, how do you think about just doubling down on investment and continuing to just accelerate your share gain versus getting back to those very high margins that you saw prior to the transition?"

So they're definitely strong contributors to this net ARR. And I think, like I mentioned in the remarks, it's strategic for us to have them embracing our broad portfolio.

First of all, as we've been kind of talking about over the last year, we do expect maintenance ARR to decrease. It started to last year in 2022, and we can see it decreasing of a couple of million dollars a quarter into 2023. And so effectively, you know, you're seeing that we're guiding generally to a flat net new subscription ARR for 2023. The other dynamics, if all things are held equal, if we look at our win rates, our pipeline, and in the macro, we actually believe we can grow faster than that. But given the current macro and where we are in the year, I think we believe this is really the right starting point as we guide for 2023. But if I were to end, I'd say we're actually really confident in the underlying demand environment, and we have the pipeline to actually support a faster growth than in the ARR side."

And then that new ARR or the ARR contribution from those new ads, it seems like you're landing at a greater pace or at a greater amount for new logos. But I know you also mentioned some, I think, you know, with revenue.

But I'm curious, one, just bigger picture, does any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year, just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one? And follow up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin.

We also talked about, though, that the component parts that were downsized maybe were put into the back half of the year pipeline and were ready for expansion motion. The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect. So, I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. You know, we feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment. And, you know, I wouldn't say there's been any change in trends of a dramatic nature."

Matt, to you, on the go-to-market side, where is your priority right now? Expansion with existing customers, given the massive growth in the portfolio and what you have to offer? or going after new customers. Clearly, everyone would want to have another 100 salespeople running around. But given what you have, how are you reorienting your salesforce right now? What is the priority? And for you, Josh, on the financial side, I want to go back to Saket's comments. Clearly, you've done a very good job in keeping up maintenance, and the price increases are clearly helping. But we're now getting into, right, the three-year mark of the real big shift in subscription. So I'm kind of wondering if there's a cohort of large customers that were on three or perhaps even five-year contracts with you that are now coming for renewal. Is there a risk that they – not a risk, but is there a possibility that they shifted to cloud in a way that creates significant step-downs in maintenance as they – shift from one tool to another help me understand that transition why should we keep thinking that maintenance will just keep on slowly gliding down rather than have big step downs sorry for the long question no no it's good good questions and again thanks for the support on the go-to-market side i"

Or is SaaS going to continue to be more of a, I guess, larger enterprise opportunity with the ability to drive easier and more cost-effective adoption?"

Guys, you continue to put up impressive top-line momentum in an environment when, frankly, most aren't, even in the security segment. And we really appreciate the bottom-line discipline that But I have a question sort of following up Etai's question on go-to-market, and it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of 23. Is there a good reason? Because people have spent a lot on security throughout 23. I guess, are you hearing this at all? And if so, Are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into 24 at the end of the year, or is budget getting pulled into 23 from 24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks."

It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow."

Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain, you know, very low across the industry and quite honestly, even within your own install base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases. In other cases, just a belief that, you know, having an EDR solution might be enough. But is there anything that Fibra can do that you think can perhaps, you know, further accelerate the adoption curve going forward?"

I think, obviously, 100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent pan for you guys. But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of, you know, legacy or best-of-breed EDR solutions. And, you know, we'd love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM. What does the profile of the customer tend to look like? Maybe the size of the customer, geo – you know, sophistication, are they more identity focused, or do you see that endpoint demand also driving demand for EPM?"

You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer."

Can you just walk us through the dynamics for this year? Is that primarily rev mix shifts? I think you mentioned headcount growth, but moderating.

I want to go back to Joe's question just on the guide, but regarding the duration tailwind that you've seen term license over the past two quarters, any color on what's driving that higher? And Josh, can you just clarify what you're expecting from a duration perspective throughout the rest of the year and how that might be impacting the different updates to the revenue and ARR guides? Thanks."

I guess first, how is demand in the quarter? And then second, has that FedRAMP high status opened up a larger pipeline with new agencies that you can now sell to? And are they also purchasing SaaS or more on-prem? Thanks."

First for you, Josh, on the bookings upside, Can you give us a little bit more color there on how much of that is duration, new customers, expansion activities stronger than you expected, the mix of products there, any color would be great. And Matt, going back to the point you mentioned to the question of EPM being complementary to EDR, it is complementary today, but clearly more and more of your portfolio right now is at the edge. I would think the browser, I would think about that as an edge product as well. And so as you're moving closer and closer to the edge, can your EPM product evolve into an EDR-like product and be competitive with an EDR solution?"

As you said, addresses the growing demand for enterprise market and designed to go beyond just log in, harvesting and browser bidder access. One recent comment you made was you believe the browser will not only enhance security, but also drive adoption of all the other solutions. I know it's still early days, but the market seems to be moving quite fast. So just curious, are you already seeing signs where the browser is seen differentiated, becoming a landing point and driving demand for other solutions? And then just a quick follow-up on Azure."

First of all, in that, you're prepared and worked, you called out some nice wins. And I just wanted to double double click on those and try to understand that or I guess confirm with you that second quarter was really driven by a host of different deals versus one or two really oversized large ones. And then second question for me, both for Matt as well as for Josh, is just getting an mention that over 50 percent are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your in your portfolio? And additionally, to just touch on any type of NRA type of a metric. I know last time you spoke, I think it was still trending above one twenty five. So we could just kind of get an indication of where it is now. That'd"

And in that, you know, you're you're coming in at the tail end of earnings and your call sounds quite different than pretty much what we've heard out there. And so I want to drill down a little bit into that relative to is there a sense of urgency you're finding from companies or customers? Excuse me. I mean, your new logo counts up. Few companies have had the the net new ARR growth in the first half that you guys have. So is it just all coming together at this point? Or is there is there some sense of urgency? Because the economy has been relatively uneven or flat at best for most."

Historically, the shape of free cash flow in any given year is a little more second half weighted, if not even throughout the year. So is there something unique in this year relative to that second half? Because I think you're you're guiding to roughly 16.5 percent the cash flow margin at the high end of the range, which is actually below your TPM numbers. Thanks."

But it's not only Matt, the CISOs that identify that have said, hey, identity is a priority here, but it's also cyber insurance companies. I know this you and I've talked about this a lot in the past, but I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year over year for the first time in a year and a half in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique. Like you spoke about the origin of the strength of the CISOs. They've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way. But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there? Is cyber insurance, because cyber insurance, to get cyber insurance at a decent price, you have to have PAM. And is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness?"

I know you guys talk a lot about how your workforce product portfolio is differentiated because, you know, you have some adjacent offerings that just makes .S.O. and MFA feel more secure. But can you talk to some of the strategic pricing initiatives you're taking that help make customers not only feel like the product portfolio is differentiated, but they're just getting much more value from it as well and how that's maybe helped driving those improving win rates?"

So I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail or maybe a taste of what maybe some of these anticipatory investments or plans or efforts or initiatives might be around benefit, you know, provided that hasn't closed yet.
