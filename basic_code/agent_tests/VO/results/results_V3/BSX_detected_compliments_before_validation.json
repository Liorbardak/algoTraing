So first on Watchman, you know, one of the things investors are paying attention to is, you know, potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the most from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the Watchman business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there. And I'll just ask my second now. On Exalt-B, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be. But, you know, hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much."

And, you know, I realize there's a lot of numbers flying around here, but to keep it simple, I think you said your organic sales growth in the first quarter of 2021 over the first quarter of 2019 was 3%. You expect an improvement on that same basis to 3% to 6% in Q2 and 2% to 5% for the full year. My question is, that suggests kind of very little incremental growth in the back half versus the first half. So is that simply conservatism, or is there something going on in the back half that we should be aware of?"

You know, I wanted to touch on, I know a lot of your procedures, some like two-thirds are outside of the hospital and the ASC setting. And a lot of these are, you know, as we learned last year, deferrable procedures. So I'd love to get a sense of how you're thinking about the potential for a backlog of patients to come through later this year and into next year and how sizable an opportunity that might be."

So it looks like, you know, you must have seen a pretty significant acceleration in March. Can you talk about the trends through the quarter, and what are you seeing in April?

And it's around, you've heard a lot of your large competitors talk about COVID sort of putting them in a stronger competitive position than they were pre-COVID. And I suspect some of that has to do with, you know, sort of stronger relationships with your hospital customers, purchasing or breadth across the portfolio and R&D productivity. Mike, I'd be curious to hear about how you think Boston's competitive positioning has changed with some of the shifting trends as it relates to COVID, if it's changed at all. Thanks so much."

If I just look at the 2Q performance and the back half implied guide, you know, we did 9% in 2Q versus pre-pandemic 2019. Back half implied is 7 and 9. I mean, we're already running, if I look at the 2Q to 4Q performance, we're already running well north of 8%. Preventus, Lumenis, once these deals become organic, they should be incremental, plus you have these pipelines.

And that's before we even start to look at company fundamentals.

Um, Mike, as I look across the portfolio, I think a lot of things held up better than I might've expected going into Q3 with all these, these COVID headwinds, you know, with, with their sphere doing better and peripheral and, and, um, uh, preventive seeming to hold up, you know, CRM and Watchman obviously doing well, even when netting out the, um, the reserve tailwind. So what I'm curious about is what you're seeing in non COVID geographies, as far as the momentum in those businesses, You know, are you taking share with some of these new products? Are you seeing accelerating momentum with some of these new categories? And why wouldn't that accelerate coming out of COVID just given, you know, some of the underlying strength that I think is there?"

The Q1 strength would insist in, you know, what specifically are you assuming for China impact? You know, similarly on EPS. It was raised by one cent at the low end, right, given the debt-free-fied bail list. Looks like operating margin is in line-ish. Maybe talk about the annual guidance for a second."

I just wanted to get a sense of the recovery within the quarter, and I just wanted to bounce something off you and see how this will translate to the rest of the year. So our sense from reports to date and from talking to some other privately held companies is that the first half of the quarter, you saw suppressed procedure volumes, then a quick rebound, and everything got compressed. into the quarter within itself the um compressed procedure trends i'm sorry suppressed procedure trends and then the recovery whereas previously it was like down one quarter the recovery the next quarter do you guys think you saw that is my first question and then as we think about the rest of the year and potentially more covid waves do you think the recovery from here is going to look more like that or there's risk excuse me of the volatility that we saw previously i guess what i'm getting at is Is there still a backlog of patients, number one? Number two, do we think this is going to be more consistent, more linear going forward? Sorry, that was a long question."

You know, the pre-pandemic comps, you know, first half, second half, 21 versus 19, they seem comparable. There was no first half versus second half. So I'm curious, what's driving the second half acceleration? You know, what was the China lockdown and contrast media impact in 2Q? Perhaps is that what's giving you the confidence looking at the underlying trends for second half?

Maybe talk about where we are in the flex rollout and what's driving that growth and how sustainable you see it or what sustains this kind of impressive growth going ahead. And on FerriPulse, we recently checked in with some early FerriPulse adopters in Europe, and they love the technology, but were concerned about price and sort of limiting their utilization.

On the recovery, obviously FX is an unknowable factor. It's going to continue. But I'm curious, to what extent are some of the other macro headwinds stabilizing or even improving, particularly staffing? I keep saying to myself, if staffing were less of an issue, maybe you would have grown even more rapidly. Is staffing still an issue? Are things stabilizing in general on the freight and costs that are getting worse? And then I have a product follow-up question."

So I'm just curious, You know, if you feel like that momentum is going to continue into 23 where you can stay one of the faster growth large cap med tech names out there, and if it's going to be more of a broad-based, you know, level of improvement across all the different franchises where you can keep kind of growing in this double-digit range in some areas, or if it's going to be a little bit more focal than what we've seen historically.

Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the three-cent reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. There's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative, just given the strengths, but love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 23, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 23 some of the higher costs will go and If we were to think about, is that sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 23 at this point, or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on.

I had two questions, so I'll just go with one here. As we go back to the analyst day, you pointed to 8% to 10% growth and 150 basis points of operating margin expansion over the three-year time frame. And I believe one of the comments was at the beginning of the range, it'll be towards the lower end and accelerate as you have some of your big new product launches coming. So I'm looking at 2024 here, and I see the street at 8% to 9% organic sales growth and about 50 basis points margin expansion.

The durability of the performance in those geographies, is it a function of just more and more products into those areas? And so, you know, that's pretty straightforward. Or is it share taking that's required or what's really required to continue to deliver?

I'm guessing, you know, having just played with the numbers, and correct me if I'm wrong, but there's some assumption of slightly faster growth there. Once you've acquired Axonics and the street previously had in there, at least that's where I end up with the numbers.

Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in interventional cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stem portfolio, obviously, and then CRM.

I guess first on TAVR, could we see top line data before the ACC presentation next year and could Boston file before that presentation? And then just the other follow-up is just on the profitability. You guys are seeing, letting a lot of profitability flow through on the outperformance on the top line. Wanted to just get a sense of of taking some of that profitability and reinvesting that, you know, where could we see, where's some of those dollars going, and just some high-level commentary on that reinvestment driving, supporting this sustainability of top-tier revenue growth in the medtech space. Thanks for taking the questions."

Mike, I wanted to go in a different direction here, away from PFA for a second, and talk about how we should think, just on this theme of sustainability of growth into 2025, appreciating we won't give guidance here, but if we think about Asian DCB launching back half of this year and modular development, in the back half, or I guess is that launching this year as well. So how do we think about those contributing and maybe elevating CRM growth above the market in next year as well as the interventional cardiology portfolio? Thanks so much."

You know, Dr. Stein, given the importance of Faripulse, can you provide more color on the Avant Garde trial and the observations you saw? And, you know, related to that, there are going to be more PFA ablation choices soon, including from the market leader. You know, once these new PFA catheters are launched, what are the factors that will lead existing Faripulse customers to stay with Faripulse or choose Faripulse if they haven't adopted it yet?

Just wanted to ask, I appreciate there's not going to be a lot. You can say, Dan, appreciate the comments that you did give on 2025, but specifically as we think about sales, you noted above market sales growth. I mean, market can be a moving target a little bit here about how you think about the markets growing next year. So I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more color if possible, even if it's just highlighting tailwinds and headwinds from a sales growth perspective to think about as we look ahead to 2025. Thanks so much."

You go back to the October 18th press release and you have Farrow Wave Navcatheter out there, but it indicates that it's exclusive to Opal on the mapping side. So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year and presumably we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach So maybe the question here is just when we enter 25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers. So maybe just walk through that dynamic a little bit. Congratulations again on the quarter."

What is the regulatory strategy? Do you expect to file with the FDA?

Mike, you called out your ops and supply chain team for keeping up with the demand for Farrah Pulse and staying on top. I just want to make sure that there's no manufacturing capacity issues next year if that franchise continues to outperform internal expectations. And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter, but I wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment. I mean, our understanding is that mapping capital and diagnostic mapping catheters, kind of the percentage of the overall ablation market, it's even higher than the ablation catheter segment. I know you guys are now well-positioned there, but just to review that and maybe just the revenue, the business model for Boston Scientific, whether this FairPulse NAV will be single use for PVIs and then just how you're building out your diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio. Sorry for the multi-part."

I had a question just on, maybe for Dan, on some of the dynamics in the gross margin line in the quarter. You mentioned FX being kind of one of the primary headwinds, but as you move into 25, maybe you can talk a little bit about you know, where the leverage in the model is. It's, you know, table gross margin and levering some of the operating investments that you're making, but maybe just some color on how you see that progressing at this point. Thanks."
