I'll ask only one question, and that one is for Vince. So, Vince, you nicely showed how you've basically increased the nutrition business since the bigger acquisition some six years ago. And if we look at it on a trailing basis, we're basically at about $550 million in operating profit. Call it somewhere halfway through of where you want to get. But we've clearly seen a significant acceleration in the last two, three years. So how should we think about your path to the $1 billion going forward? Is this going to be a six-year time to get there? Is it going to be accelerated just because of the flexibility of And as Juan just said, he's going to give you a little bit more capital and opportunities as you have a long list for football on M&A. So how should we think about the growth performance, M&A versus organic, and when do you think that medium-term target can be achieved?"

As I said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in RPO business or maybe South American oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business, we still expect exports from our services to be very strong. We have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year. We don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for our services and all cities in 2021. Car Solutions, I think that that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impacted by COVID-19. And we think that Last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some exports to China in ethanol, We expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020. And the nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business. And it's a business that have a strong organic growth program. And we see, you know, we see in that range, as I mentioned before, that when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition, as we grow nutrition to the billion dollar OP, during our plan, we look for a 15% CAGR to get there, and that's what we're expecting for this year. So that's how I think about 2021."

My first question is on nutrition, just to add a little bit more clarity to that. Last year, you had talked about harvesting more of your investments. You built a lot of plants in South America, in Asia for your farm. nutrition business. And, you know, I still expect that harvesting that investment is still a big part of your earnings story and your margin story. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in your harvesting of margins for nutrition? And I'm sure it differs between human and animal, but can you help us with that a little bit?"

And you've just said, This will be another year in the need of investments in order to get to that 15% CAGR you've been talking about. So if we think about the capex in general, that $900 million to maybe a billion dollar, which is clearly up from what we saw in the last two years, could you give us a little bit of an understanding how you allocate or how you plan to allocate within that capex to to the different segments, and in particular the nutrition business, just to understand how much capital you're adding to that business."

We've been able to grow that revenue during this quarter, And we've been able to maintain margins, which, you know, it has been a very good job of controlling gross margins and the beta margin on sales. Our enthusiasm is not only for the categories in which we are positioned, but also on the win rates and the customer engagements. Our customer engagements as of, you know, in 2021 have doubled. our customer engagement last year. And as the economy is reopening and food service become more active, customers are more willing to launch new promotions and new products, something that they were not doing before. So we see that acceleration, whether it's in beverages or in health and wellness or alternative proteins. So, again, I think you should think conservatively 15% per year, more aggressively 20% per year, but in that range we will be growing over the next few years."

And when you talk about managing risks, it's both managing the risks of the inputs and the outputs. And so the position gains that we had in the quarter, in the second quarter, 90 million, it's a combination of what I call the ethanol complex, right? So it's a combination of how they're managing the corn, how they're managing ethanol, how they're managing RINs, all these positions. And as you know, it was a very volatile quarter when you looked at the prices of corn and ethanol and RINs. but they managed exceptionally well. And so, you know, 90 million, normally they would generate risk management gains. We highlighted this quarter because this was an exceptional quarter. And by the way, it wasn't just an exceptional quarter. It was an exceptional first half of the year. Because when you take a look at the first half of the year, They probably had positioning gains roughly a similar amount in the first quarter as well. So therefore, the CARB Solutions team really hit it out of the ballpark in terms of risk management in the first half of this year."

That gives us a lot of confidence for North America for the second half. Listen, let me be clear. The oilseeds and our services business will have a very strong year, much better than last year, and we expect a strong second half as well. That will drive the company to earnings that we never had before, certainly, and certainly will be probably on the higher side or maybe outside the range of $4 to $4.50 that I mentioned before that was the previous landing spot of our strategy.

Other and corporate and interest kind of basically seemingly netting out to roughly flat year over year. Tax rate flat to maybe up slightly year over year. So I guess the two pieces of the puzzle that are missing from there are ag services and oil seeds profit and carbohydrate solutions. Thank you. ethanol remains somewhat of a wild card on carbohydrates, although the rest of starches and sweeteners, you sound generally constructive. So can you help us, Juan, Vikram, just thinking about kind of range of outcomes on ag services and oil seeds based on where crush margins are today, kind of assuming, let's say, an average U.S. crop, no enormous supply dislocation coming out of the U.S. in the second half of the year, just how kind of the profit outlook would be tracking in ag services and oilseeds, and if there's anything else on a year-on-year basis you want us to be considering, that would be really helpful."

And I think that's been a very important growth engine. And typically, the sales cycle in flavors tends to be shorter than some of our other product portfolios. So just keep that in mind. That momentum is building. And we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month over month. We anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly continuing into 2024. The other aspect is EBITDA margins of flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion. And finally, flavors contribution year to date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50%. So important to keep that at the back of your mind as you think about the future."

The liquid sweetener volumes have been steady, and this has happened throughout this year. Almost every quarter we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico, as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded. The biosolutions market, we're actually extending into newer applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23%. Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins. Ethanol, you know what's going on in ethanol. The margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got significant, actually higher domestic driving miles. Now, when you think about next year, I mean, we well set up the Q4 of 23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipate in 2023 and early 24 contracting in North America, sweeteners and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive, and similarly for ethanol. You know that tends to be volatile, but right now, the general trend is to be supportive of a higher for longer ethanol margin environment."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine, at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Allseeds and CARB solutions continuing. Ag Services and Allseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes, and I think that that's a multi-year trend, so we're going to see higher crash margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our services business continued to grow around the world with the strength of destination marketing. And that exacerbated concern about food security that brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world. So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor. CARB solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses we are finding new demand for those products that will do two things. Will grow us revenue into new categories like we're seeing in bio solutions that is growing double digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time. And we've seen that already. So those are the two. And I think nutrition and Bikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year. This year, maybe you call it the pause that refreshes. We took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation, that continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in health and wellness, in what we're seeing in flavors, or the specialty pieces of animal nutrition, or the demand generation in pets. where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share and we're growing faster than the competitors. So we see that with a lot of optimism for next year."

But I think it also applies to the broader portfolio, which is fully agree with Juan in the sense that the base business animal nutrition is now experiencing the benefits of the cost improvement programs that we put in place. And we've seen that evolution quarter and quarter. But to Juan's observations on a going forward basis, you will see a business that is looking to become more focused on the specialty side of its portfolio. As Juan alluded to at the beginning, part of the revenue calculation for the platform is partly impacted by the fact that there is a soy meal commodity component to some of the products that are produced over time. It's a business that will evolve to become more specialty focused, more higher margin focused. So I think it bodes well for the growth and margin structure of that business as we look forward into 2025."

As Juan mentioned during the remarks, we have more than 1200 initiatives, but they can be grouped into substantial areas or themes of effort and focus. Working on plant process optimization, working on business process optimization, also very important on supply chain and demand fulfillment, which is part of the challenges that we've had in nutrition. So these would be the large buckets that we're working on. And we've seen the platform progress very well. We have at least about a third line of sight of the 500 million already for 2024. So we're very encouraged about the ability of this drive for excellence impacting 2024 already in the measures that I've just outlined."

Pablo Alarc?n Pe?a.: : That we put together at the beginning of the year has continued to accelerate so so far we are on track, if you think about. 500 million in over two years. That's about $125 million per half. We delivered about $127 million in the first half. So we're pretty much on track there. But this group of activities and projects and ideas continue to accelerate. So that's not going to be linear. It's going to be an accelerated bringing up to the P&L and to the bottom line. So we feel very good about it. We are very confident that Our forecast shows that we're going to deliver on the 500 million wave before the two-year mark. With regard to what's the distribution of that, of course, sometimes when you have more bigger manufacturing units or bigger energy consumption, like in Carb Solutions, you have more opportunities to bring that. So I would say if I were to name a ranking today, Initially, out of the gate, we see more in carb solutions and nutrition because of some of the improvements we needed to make in demand fulfillment, and maybe ag services and oilseeds having to pick up momentum during the second half, so we will see that. But overall, I think good distribution of projects around the four geographies and the And again, catching momentum when you have a big organization that you need to promote all these activities. So not everybody starts at the same time. So we feel very good by being on track. And again, we think ahead of schedule for our 500 million over two years."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thank you, Manav, for the question. We have been seeing for a while that exports have been increasing year over year. So ethanol continues to be one of the cheapest arcoxylates out there, and it's very competitive with gasoline in many parts of the world. So we have seen a strong domestic demand because of miles driven in the US, especially now with the summer. We have been seeing good blending in the US. I think that the price of ethanol is very competitive to encourage blending. And we have seen exports at levels that we never seen before, probably north of 1.7, maybe even 1.9 billion gallons per year. So I think that that was a very logical kind of when you see that the strong demand was very logical that prices will rebound. And again, we don't see any change for now. It will depend on how much the U.S. produces, of course, of ethanol. But at this point in time, margins are holding, and we think that it bodes well for a strong Q3. In terms of sweeteners and starches, that business continues to have very robust volumes and very good margins. If anything, you can see a little bit of a pullback of the energy complex, if you will. That bodes well for manufacturing costs because these are big facilities. They consume a lot of energy. So natural gas prices being close to $2 is a little bit of a tailwind for us. So CarbSolution is having a very good year, and we expect that to continue."
