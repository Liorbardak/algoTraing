You know, maybe just a little bit on timing, complexity of the alternatives you're looking at, and then certainly on the debt side specifically, it sounds like that could be a solution that, again, you referenced, bridges the company to break even in 2024.

We expect the remaining 2200 liter batches that were produced up until the middle of 2021 to be depleted or meaning sold throughout the next couple quarters be completely sold by the middle of 2023. Substantially, we've already sold the majority of the 2200 to date. There's a couple of quarters to go that we feel, but the 4400 will be sold exclusively starting in the middle of 2023 at the higher margin production process, again, in the 20% to 30% range for the 4400 batch production leader process."

Maybe, Adam, to start, we can talk a little bit just about hyperimmune globulin specifically. Certainly, there's momentum and incentive here. Your prepared remarks point towards stickiness, but also continued new patient volumes for incentive. And then your competitor and supplier, Griffles, also reported a very strong hyperimmune globulin number for their quarter and one Q of 23. So maybe just to level set us a little bit here on the state of hyperimmune globulins, And then specific to ADMA, just the tailwinds we're seeing in Ascentive, how sustainable is the momentum in new patient starts? And over time, how sticky can this prove to be on those patients as we continue to move ahead here? And then I'll have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks."

Let me also add my congratulations to you on another great quarter and the pattern that we've really seen emerge over the last couple quarters here. So I wanted to ask you a bit more on incentive utilization. If I look at some of your publications, posters, et cetera, it really seems that the benefits are quite broad. I mean, the age of the patients, the underlying comorbidities, the time to treatment, it seems pretty diverse amongst the patients yet the benefits are all there. So curious if real time you're seeing that the effects represent a broad patient population or if there's a specific type that you've seen. And then can you talk about some of your plans maybe the next 12 months to collect and report on more of these case studies?"

Now, I think six quarters of a beaten race, so it's great to see, and congratulations to the team. Maybe, Adam, we hosted an immunologist call a few weeks ago just exploring the use case for Ascentive, And a few interesting data points come out of that call. One is that in particular in this individual's practice, they are actually seeing, you know, benefits in these patients where, you know, they were quote unquote refractory to traditional immunoglobulins. So maybe from the company standpoint and anecdotally, when you think about these complex immune deficient patients that are susceptible to, you know, follow on respiratory infections, They're complex. They're not responding to immunoglobulins. You know, what are you hearing from a broader set of your immunologists that are treating these patients? So that would be the first question. And the second question is, you know, one of the data points that came out of that call is, you know, perhaps there needs to be more physician education around the benefits of Ascentive. in order to unlock really having this product reach more of these complex patients. And so what is the sort of go-to-market strategy here now that Ascentiv is sort of becoming a go-to solution here? Are you increasing the sales efforts to reach more of these patients? And I'll have a follow-up for Brian. Thanks."

One would be just on pipeline, just kind of curious, we haven't heard anything on subcutaneous versions of Bivagam and Ascentive. Is that in the cards at some point? And then Brian, just on plasma supply, we're at 10 centers in total, nine have FDA clearance. Is 10 kind of the right number? Or when you look out over the next two to three years, do you think that that plasma network collection base grows beyond the 10 where we're at today. Thanks again. Congratulations."

First question I have is, you know, maybe something I didn't really fully appreciate about the story is that the KOL community and treating physicians are a lot more tight-knit than I expected. So just given that you've continued to showcase your data and findings and just the word of mouth around these positive case studies, Wanted to ask how much of the treating community you estimate is aware of the added benefits that Ascentive is showing here? And then looking into the next two years or so, anything beyond your guidance that you're working on in terms of getting the word out more in terms of like conference appearances? And you talked about, you know, these potential patient representatives as well."

And the first thought in my head is, you know, are they paying attention yet to the performance here? But in looking ahead, I think one of the questions that we get, you know, from folks out there, and it seems like you touched on it, is, is where we are. And I think the, you know, the capacity utilization today of the business with the center of growing, you know, much faster than expected and ViviGam certainly looking like it's gaining steady market share in the, in the traditional IG market. So maybe just a little bit on where capacity utilization is today. And you spoke a little bit about the peak potential of this business. You know, you look at the guidance you put out there for 24 and 25 and When we do our math, there's a lot of room for variability, but we get to a number that's quite a bit higher than your 2025 number. But how should we be thinking about capacity utilization today and bracketing where the peak potential is for this business? And I'll have a couple of follow-ups."

As you have a very unique position giving you insight into forecasting revenues I wanted to ask at what point you might consider reinvesting some of this capital to either expand the business or improve things on the manufacturing front, or if there's anything else you're looking at.
