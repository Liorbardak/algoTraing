So if you wanna build a pandemic portfolio, you wanna have Therasphear. So Therasphear is doing extremely well, grew I think mid teens in the quarter, taking share and is really not a procedure that can be deferred. So the interventional oncology business broadly is doing well, really driven by Therasphear. So I'd say on the sales piece of it, and they also saw Spec Pharma do quite well. So from a sales standpoint, the BTG portfolio has been more robust than legacy BSC, which is great news. And integration, we got ahead of that pre-pandemic. So we're very much on track with the cost synergies commitment that we've made, which is the summer. And most of that work had already been done and implemented pre-COVID pandemic. There's a few facility closures that we're working through that may be temporarily delayed, but overall I would say the cost synergies are on track, if not ahead of track. And the integration of the commercial teams is really kind of taking place. I think that's all systems go."

So first on Watchman, you know, one of the things investors are paying attention to is, you know, potential competitor coming to market. And I was hoping maybe you could outline what the most from a competitive perspective are that you've built around the Watchman business that should make us feel okay about the continued growth trajectory there. And I'll just ask my second now. On Exalt-B, given the financial constraints at hospitals, I'm just curious about how quickly that can be the meaningful revenue contributor that it probably ultimately will be. But, you know, hospitals have to work through their current financial duress. And those are my questions. Thanks so much."

I mean, we're already running, if I look at the 2Q to 4Q performance, we're already running well north of 8%. Preventus, Lumenis, once these deals become organic, they should be incremental, plus you have these pipelines.

Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good."

And why wouldn't that accelerate coming out of COVID just given, you know, some of the underlying strength that I think is there?"

The Q1 strength would insist in, you know, what specifically are you assuming for China impact? You know, similarly on EPS. It was raised by one cent at the low end, right, given the debt-free-fied bail list. Looks like operating margin is in line-ish. Maybe talk about the annual guidance for a second."

I just wanted to get a sense of the recovery within the quarter, and I just wanted to bounce something off you and see how this will translate to the rest of the year. So our sense from reports to date and from talking to some other privately held companies is that the first half of the quarter, you saw suppressed procedure volumes, then a quick rebound, and everything got compressed. into the quarter within itself the um compressed procedure trends i'm sorry suppressed procedure trends and then the recovery whereas previously it was like down one quarter the recovery the next quarter do you guys think you saw that is my first question and then as we think about the rest of the year and potentially more covid waves do you think the recovery from here is going to look more like that or there's risk excuse me of the volatility that we saw previously i guess what i'm getting at is Is there still a backlog of patients, number one? Number two, do we think this is going to be more consistent, more linear going forward? Sorry, that was a long question."

Maybe just walk through where you're seeing those pressures and you know, how you're offsetting it in the base business.

You know, the pre-pandemic comps, you know, first half, second half, 21 versus 19, they seem comparable. There was no first half versus second half. So I'm curious, what's driving the second half acceleration? You know, what was the China lockdown and contrast media impact in 2Q? Perhaps is that what's giving you the confidence looking at the underlying trends for second half? And then on the gross margin, $375 million of cost, do you know what – What dollar amount of that is capitalized on the balance sheet? Thank you."

So, Dan, I was hoping you might be able to give us an early look into next year. How elevated is the spending? There's a lot of moving pieces with OpEx and currency and the share count.

And I guess I'm thankful that I've got about six months to get to know this humorous side that everyone's referring to. So I look forward to that. Just one follow-up, if I could, on margins. Dan, you talked about the impact of FX, and it seems like that explains pretty much the three-cent reduction in EPS guide for the year. Just maybe one question on trajectory. There's such a strong Q3 here. You're adjusting Q4 for EPS and top end of the range for organic growth. That strikes me as a little bit conservative, just given the strengths, but love your comment on that. And then maybe you're not talking much about 23, but the shape of margins. I know there's been a lot of questions around how far into 23 some of the higher costs will go and If we were to think about, is that sort of a front half, back half that we should be thinking about for 23 at this point, or I'm sure it's too early to say, but any insight you can give on how we should think about costs as they roll through inventory and P&L and so on.

So maybe for Dr. Stein, you know, you talked about your, you know, excitement for the ADVENT trial later this year. Can you help put the manifest PF data into context? You know, how did that compare to prior RF and cryo studies? And what would be a win for you in Advent, you know, for Farrah Pulse? And we're going to see, the second part is we're going to see the Medtronic Pulse Select data at ACC, the J&J Inspire data at Boston AF, I guess, this weekend. You talked about how Farrah Pulse is differentiated. What should we be looking for in those studies that would support, you know, your comments earlier? Thanks for taking the questions."

Great, great performance in the first quarter, particularly on the top line. We all know this is probably the last easy comp from COVID trends in first quarter last year. But would love to get a sense of, you know, what are you seeing globally? How sustainable is this? You know, you guided to a slight deceleration second quarter. Anything to note there other than conservatism? And then second, you know, there have been some news reports lately about M&A on the behalf of Boston Scientific. We'd love to just get a refresh on your M&A strategy. We've seen a lot more smaller tuck-in type deals historically. You know, is that still the goal? And any thoughts there? Thanks a lot."

How are you thinking about the evolution of Farrapulse, you know, beyond its current geometry and energy source? And Mike, you know, we all completely understand you won't comment on rumors, but, you know, there are interesting assets in medtech that would you know, push you to over four and a half times leverage or require the use of equity to relatively large deals.

Um, and then on, on the capital allocation side, um, I know you're not going to comment on market speculation, so this is not related to market speculation, but can you just remind us, in current interest rate environment, what kind of leverage levels would Boston be comfortable with?

I mean, this has been a market, the AF ablation market, that's been a double-digit grower for the last decade plus. But is it right to think about Farrah Pulse and just the advent of pulse field ablation overall as potentially accelerating market growth in a meaningfully and sustainable way? because of the safety profile of the device, or how are you thinking about, and what are you seeing, I guess, in Europe about market growth overall for this device?

And separately, what have the success rates been with RF and cryo in previous studies when using the same criteria as ADVENT? And sorry for the long question.

And I believe one of the comments was at the beginning of the range, it'll be towards the lower end and accelerate as you have some of your big new product launches coming.

You know, at your analyst day, you had talked to, you know, an expectation and a level of confidence that you could disrupt that market in the U.S. relatively quickly out of the gate. I'm just curious with, you know, I get something approaching 20% share of the market over time, which is what you've done you know, in other markets with your disruption capabilities. I'm just curious, does anything change there with the indeterminate kind of view of what the next steps are for the U.S.? I'm just trying to focus on that commentary a bit. You know, does your outlook for the franchise in the U.S. change in TAVR? And then I have a follow-up."

You updated your LRP in September of last year to 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024 to 2026. The assumption at the time was that growth in 2025 would accelerate over 2024. You're guiding today to 10% to 12% organic growth. So the question is, do you still expect growth to accelerate in 2025? And how should we think about the 8% to 10% CAGR in the context to this strong 2024 guidance? Thanks for taking the question."

For my one question, I wanted to look at some of the, I'll call them legacy businesses. Not sure if that's fair to describe them, maybe slower growth businesses. I mean, a CRM mid-single-digit growth is very strong. Interventional cardiology of double digits, very strong. Just curious about how to think about those sort of slower growth in interventional cardiology. I'm thinking more on the drug-eluting stem portfolio, obviously, and then CRM. Can they sustain these kinds of growth profiles, given that the end markets are, from a volume perspective, are arguably probably some of your slower growth end markets? And what needs to happen from an innovation perspective to sustain that sort of growth? Thanks so much."

Wanted to just get a sense of of taking some of that profitability and reinvesting that, you know, where could we see, where's some of those dollars going, and just some high-level commentary on that reinvestment driving, supporting this sustainability of top-tier revenue growth in the medtech space.

So in other words, the company is coming with a closed loop offering here next year and presumably we'll have competitors that are coming with a bundled approach So maybe the question here is just when we enter 25, it seems that three competitors will be out there with a bundled approach to PFA with mappers.
