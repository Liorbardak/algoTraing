So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter."

And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine-month sales cycles, and we're excited about the, you know, kind of the record, continued record growth that we have in pipeline, and we'll be continuing to expand our sales teams globally. and going into each of the quarters through the second half of the year. They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year."

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SAS deal size are similar to historic perpetual deal size, which is great."

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition?

Obviously, CyberArk's focus is the enterprise, so I just wanted to... you know, confirmed that you are not seeing any elongation in sales cycles among any of your customer segments, including at the enterprise level. And then secondly, for Josh, you know, did the prior ARR guidance, which I believe was 535 to 541, did that not include any FX headwinds? Just wanted to clarify that as well. Thanks."

I mean, it looks like you've got a little bit more difficult comp in 4Q for net new ARR growth, but just maybe give us a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance. and the level of confidence you have to hit that and considerations you might need to make as we, you know, fine tune our model."

And then that new ARR or the ARR contribution from those new ads, it seems like you're landing at a greater pace or at a greater amount for new logos.

I mean, it's great to see the maintenance of the margins, just given the increased mix shift to the radical side of the business. But I'm curious, one, just bigger picture, does any change in your thoughts on the pace of investments for this year, just given some of the macro and any change to your hiring plans on number one? And follow up to that, just I think you changed your kind of guidance a little bit on the free cash flow, just that it should be five points ahead of net income margin, where I think it was previously kind of in line with net income margin. So just Curious to change there, given some of the what seems like duration pressure that is hitting buildings a little bit."

I recall, like, you know, right after that, we had, what, like, SolarWinds and Log4J, and everyone kind of, like, trued up and realized the value of PAM and kind of trued up the deals, and you saw a reacceleration.

You gave an example of a customer, the Fortune 100 transportation company, who cited the threat and That was a key motivator in the expansion deal.

Maybe the question for you, though, is I think we're taking the revenue guide up slightly at the bottom end.

We also talked about, though, that the component parts that were downsized maybe were put into the back half of the year pipeline and were ready for expansion motion. The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect. So, I would say the market itself continues to stabilize around us. You know, we feel like we're in a strong position vis-a-vis the macros at the moment. And, you know, I wouldn't say there's been any change in trends of a dramatic nature."

And we really appreciate the bottom-line discipline that But I have a question sort of following up Etai's question on go-to-market, and it's something you might not have much control over. Are there any general trends worth noting for the second half of this year? For instance, we're generally hearing about exhausted security budgets coming into the end of 23. Is there a good reason? Because people have spent a lot on security throughout 23. I guess, are you hearing this at all? And if so, Are you seeing any deals that might be getting pushed out into 24 at the end of the year, or is budget getting pulled into 23 from 24 to satisfy current security needs? Thanks."

Maybe building on that journey, you just put out a press release on Indiana University Hospital, expanding relations with CyberArk. Maybe a good opportunity here to share with us what is it that they're doing with CyberRock on top of their core PAM deployment, and where else can they expand with you guys in the coming years? And I have a follow-up."

It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow."

                "quoted_compliment": "Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions and a nice job on the Q1. Matt, I'd like to ask about EPM because it's an important solution and yet penetration rates remain, you know, very low across the industry and quite honestly, even within your own install base. And I think much of this might be due to a lack of awareness of EPM in some cases. In other cases, just a belief that, you know, having an EDR solution might be enough. But is there anything that Fibra can do that you think can perhaps, you know, further accelerate the adoption curve going forward?"

I think, obviously, 100 million ARR is a great milestone, and it's a substantial adjacent pan for you guys. But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers? And this is layer on top of, you know, legacy or best-of-breed EDR solutions. And, you know, we'd love to understand maybe the profile as you see customers adopt EPM. What does the profile of the customer tend to look like? Maybe the size of the customer, geo – you know, sophistication, are they more identity focused, or do you see that endpoint demand also driving demand for EPM?"

                "quoted_compliment": "Thanks, Rob. So overall, we had a strong quarter, our ability to be able to continue to drive momentum in the market. You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there."

                "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer."

I mean, basically, you know, we're excited that we'll be able to, that we're raising the metrics across all boards from cash flow through the operating, through the revenue, through the operating. You know, in terms of, you know, color on that, We do expect SAS to be a bigger player on the revenue side as we go into Q2 and into the second half. With regard to the investments, you know, we're catching up on some hiring, on the slower hiring from Q1, and we anticipate to continue hiring into the second half as well, and You know, so that's where we'll see some of the investment side in R&D and also, of course, in the go-to-market engine, as we always like to pre-hire when we look at multiple years of growth. You know, I think, you know, from another perspective, in terms of the mix, you know, we see the mix continuing on other than the fact that, you know, we see it kind of inching up towards some more SaaS business."

I think it really starts with the demand environment that Matt talked a lot about already in the earlier questions and in his prepared remarks. And that's kind of generating the pipeline coverage and the demand generation that we're seeing for the course of the rest of the year. I think the other point is we're well positioned from a go-to-market team and engine. Matt just alluded to the fact about where we are on quota reps and quota carriers. And just pretty much everything that we see coming out of Q1, first of all coming out of Q4, and then what we saw in Q1, And what we're seeing in the pipeline going forward and the overall demand environment that we're getting from the customer base, we're confident on being able to raise the guidance across those metrics."

So on the first front when we when we look at the bookings performance in the quarter remember bookings has nothing to do with duration, so the duration we just wanted to be transparent was a bump up in the quarter it's about three and a half million of contribution around revenue. But it but it but it's not a contributing factor to the strength of our overall business, the strength of our overall business. is based upon continued growth across the entire portfolio. We continue to see AAR just grow really strongly for each piece of the platform. Now, I highlighted in the call kind of particular strength in the secrets management business, and I'm very excited by that because that, again, is showing our ability to compete effectively as a security sale in the machine identity space. So I would highlight that. I would also highlight, as we talked about earlier, our ability to be able to go back into the base and expand customers beyond PAM or securing IT into new areas like securing developers or our ability to be able to go compete effectively in the quarter around workforce and our differentiated workforce solution. So across the board, I can point to the entire portfolio, talk about strong bookings, and that kind of comes from that overall approach. Remind me again of the second question?"

As you said, addresses the growing demand for enterprise market and designed to go beyond just log in, harvesting and browser bidder access. One recent comment you made was you believe the browser will not only enhance security, but also drive adoption of all the other solutions. I know it's still early days, but the market seems to be moving quite fast. So just curious, are you already seeing signs where the browser is seen differentiated, becoming a landing point and driving demand for other solutions? And then just a quick follow-up on Azure."

And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here.
