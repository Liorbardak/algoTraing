    "quoted_compliment": "Sure, on the integration front, the largest one, BTG, has performed extremely well during the pandemic. So if you wanna build a pandemic portfolio, you wanna have Therasphear. So Therasphear is doing extremely well, grew I think mid teens in the quarter, taking share and is really not a procedure that can be deferred. So the interventional oncology business broadly is doing well, really driven by Therasphear. So I'd say on the sales piece of it, and they also saw Spec Pharma do quite well. So from a sales standpoint, the BTG portfolio has been more robust than legacy BSC, which is great news. And integration, we got ahead of that pre-pandemic. So we're very much on track with the cost synergies commitment that we've made, which is the summer. And most of that work had already been done and implemented pre-COVID pandemic. There's a few facility closures that we're working through that may be temporarily delayed, but overall I would say the cost synergies are on track, if not ahead of track. And the integration of the commercial teams is really kind of taking place. I think that's all systems go.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Good morning and thank you very much for all the information you provided. I have two questions, I'll put them right up front. I'm curious how you're doing with some of the integration of the acquisitions you've made over the last 18 months, particularly BTG in this current environment and what you're really seeing there. ____ ",

And I guess I'm just wondering if your positivity on July is, you think, differentially related to your portfolio, your products, your exposures, or Are we seeing just the benefit of having more hindsight, and do you think that we're seeing more broad recovery through the month for the MedTech space?",

And one follow-up, you know, in the supplemental presentation and the prepared commentary, you talked about being able to resume a normal pace of account openings for Lotus and restarting a lot of your clinical trial activities.

And I guess I was just hoping to get some color on how you're able to do that with the COVID flare-ups because, you know, that does – kind of fly in the face of it, but it seems like you're optimistic you'll be returning to a more normal pace here. ____ ",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, so if you think about that, you take a step back and look at third quarter, and that's why I started my script that I'm really proud of the team's global execution. Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Hi, thank you, and can you hear me okay? Thanks. Oh, great. Good morning. Thank you. So first question is pretty straightforward. I'm just curious how your thoughts on Q4 have evolved since the analyst day and what you're seeing today in terms of procedure volumes, you know, especially in the U.S.? ? Great.

You have obviously a lot of strong growth drivers contributing, you know, currently in Q4, but importantly throughout, you know, 2022, you have this cadence of new acquisitions that are kind of rolling in.

Mike, you called out your ops and supply chain team for keeping up with the demand for Farrah Pulse and staying on top. I just want to make sure that there's no manufacturing capacity issues next year if that franchise continues to outperform internal expectations. And then also just sorry to follow up on a two-parter, but I wanted to just get your team's view on this mapping segment. I mean, our understanding is that mapping capital and diagnostic mapping catheters, kind of the percentage of the overall ablation market, it's even higher than the ablation catheter segment. I know you guys are now well-positioned there, but just to review that and maybe just the revenue, the business model for Boston Scientific, whether this FairPulse NAV will be single use for PVIs and then just how you're building out your diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio. Sorry for the multi-part. Just in terms of the diagnostic mapping catheter portfolio build-out, you guys do have a high-density mapping catheter in the pipeline, is my understanding, but just wanted to get a better look on that. I'll just add on, and then we'll move on to the next one. There are elements of the procedure that we don't compete in today, that pie, like ice catheters and others. So we're doing extremely well in the ablation portion of it. We expect OPAL to do quite well in the mapping segment, which we've been – underscaled in, but there's still segments within the EP procedure mix that we don't plan today that we're shooting to fill out in the portfolio over time. I'll just make one other comment on Ferripulse relates to China for, it wasn't a question, but we're excited about the approval in Japan and in China. We do expect the China launch to be a bit slower. than what you typically see in the US and Japan based on obviously not product or team, but it's more on getting approvals and registries and launch cadence in terms of the volume of new accounts. We've done some recent openings there that have gone quite well, but we don't anticipate the same aggressive launch in China that you've seen in US. We do expect to have a very strong launch in Japan. And also just a shout out to the China team. Despite the significant VBP headwinds that we've seen, which have impacted our IBIS franchise. There'll be more VBPs in 2025. You know, we continue to grow essentially at the company average in China, despite those headwinds, when many of our peers have faced tougher results.____",
