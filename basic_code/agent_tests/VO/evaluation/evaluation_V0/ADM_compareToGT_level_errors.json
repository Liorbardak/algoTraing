As I said before, maybe with a different mix of earnings with maybe we're not going to get to the same levels in RPO business or maybe South American oils, but we're going to have a better canola and soft seed margins in general for the business, we still expect exports from our services to be very strong. We have an exceptionally strong year for global trade in 2020, which I think we're going to have a strong year. We don't know exactly we're going to get to the same level. So we plan another outstanding year for our services and all cities in 2021. Car Solutions, I think that that's the business, as Ray explained it before, that has been the biggest impacted by COVID-19. And we think that Last year, it was a very tough year in which the team did an outstanding job of growing earnings 11% in that environment. And we think that conditions for this year, especially when you think about the pent-up demand, the improvements in conditions with more prevalent vaccination in the second half and all that, and with some exports to China in ethanol, We expect there are many elements there to build a more constructive scenario in 2021 than in 2020. And the nutrition business will continue to grow. We are investing in that business. And it's a business that have a strong organic growth program. And we see, you know, we see in that range, as I mentioned before, that when we look at the strategic plan for nutrition, as we grow nutrition to the billion dollar OP, during our plan, we look for a 15% CAGR to get there, and that's what we're expecting for this year.

Thank you. ethanol remains somewhat of a wild card on carbohydrates, although the rest of starches and sweeteners, you sound generally constructive. So can you help us, Juan, Vikram, just thinking about kind of range of outcomes on ag services and oil seeds based on where crush margins are today, kind of assuming, let's say, an average U.S. crop, no enormous supply dislocation coming out of the U.S. in the second half of the year, just how kind of the profit outlook would be tracking in ag services and oilseeds, and if there's anything else on a year-on-year basis you want us to be considering, that would be really helpful.",

That momentum is building. And we see that momentum through our revenue pipeline, which is increasing month over month. We anticipate momentum in Q4 and frankly continuing into 2024. The other aspect is EBITDA margins of flavors is also increasing. It's not just revenue growth. The profit is also as a consequence of EBITDA margin expansion. And finally, flavors contribution year to date overall as a part of nutrition profitability is a little over 50%. So important to keep that at the back of your mind as you think about the future.",

Almost every quarter we've said that. So the demand has been pretty resilient, and the margin structure has been strong. The other thing that's actually helpful is strong exports to Mexico, as well as higher sugar prices. The specialty volumes in North America have been a bit soft, but with the improved mix and pricing, our margins have actually expanded. The biosolutions market, we're actually extending into newer applications, and that revenue growth year-to-date is 23%. Wheat flour demand has been resilient. The optimization I referred to in my comments has actually helped improve the cost structure and expand margins. Ethanol, you know what's going on in ethanol. The margin structure there is very supportive given domestic demand, blend economics, strong U.S. exports, as well as the fact that we've got significant, actually higher domestic driving miles. Now, when you think about next year, I mean, we well set up the Q4 of 23, and I already talked about that. It's a little early to say, but based on the strong finish that we anticipate in 2023 and early 24 contracting in North America, sweeteners and starches, we are optimistic for solid volumes and our ability to actually maintain and potentially even expand margins in our core starches and sweeteners portfolio. We'll tell you more in our February call, but going in, the outlook is constructive, and similarly for ethanol. You know that tends to be volatile, but right now, the general trend is to be supportive of a higher for longer ethanol margin environment.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thank you, Ben. Good question. Listen, we see 2024 with a lot of optimism. We're working through the plan right now, as you can imagine, at this time of the year. We continue to see the strength of Ag Services and Allseeds and CARB solutions continuing. Ag Services and Allseeds, we have seen some fundamental structural changes, and I think that that's a multi-year trend, so we're going to see higher crash margins, at least in the United States for quite a while. And our services business continued to grow around the world with the strength of destination marketing. And that exacerbated concern about food security that brought by all the geopolitics and the weather events and the pandemic and all that continues and continue to enhance margins for us to the service we provide around the world. So we see that business being very solid and very strong contributor. CARB solutions, I think that Vikram touched a little bit on the dynamics of the contracting for next year. But beyond that, I think that you have to remember that we are having different uses we are finding new demand for those products that will do two things. Will grow us revenue into new categories like we're seeing in bio solutions that is growing double digits. But it's also going to tighten up the supply for the existing products. So that will be constructive to margins over time. And we've seen that already. So those are the two. And I think nutrition and Bikram went into a lot of detail into that and all the different pieces. And we're very confident we're going to go back to growth next year. This year, maybe you call it the pause that refreshes. We took a pause this year. But the fundamental innovation engine that we have, that's our differentiation, that continues to resonate strongly, whether it's in health and wellness, in what we're seeing in flavors, or the specialty pieces of animal nutrition, or the demand generation in pets. where the markets are normal and we apply that properly, we are winning more than our fair share and we're growing faster than the competitors.

And we've seen that evolution quarter and quarter. But to Juan's observations on a going forward basis, you will see a business that is looking to become more focused on the specialty side of its portfolio. As Juan alluded to at the beginning, part of the revenue calculation for the platform is partly impacted by the fact that there is a soy meal commodity component to some of the products that are produced over time. It's a business that will evolve to become more specialty focused, more higher margin focused.

So these would be the large buckets that we're working on. And we've seen the platform progress very well. We have at least about a third line of sight of the 500 million already for 2024.

That's about $125 million per half. We delivered about $127 million in the first half. So we're pretty much on track there. But this group of activities and projects and ideas continue to accelerate. So that's not going to be linear. It's going to be an accelerated bringing up to the P&L and to the bottom line. So we feel very good about it. We are very confident that Our forecast shows that we're going to deliver on the 500 million wave before the two-year mark. With regard to what's the distribution of that, of course, sometimes when you have more bigger manufacturing units or bigger energy consumption, like in Carb Solutions, you have more opportunities to bring that. So I would say if I were to name a ranking today, Initially, out of the gate, we see more in carb solutions and nutrition because of some of the improvements we needed to make in demand fulfillment, and maybe ag services and oilseeds having to pick up momentum during the second half, so we will see that. But overall, I think good distribution of projects around the four geographies and the And again, catching momentum when you have a big organization that you need to promote all these activities.

So ethanol continues to be one of the cheapest arcoxylates out there, and it's very competitive with gasoline in many parts of the world. So we have seen a strong domestic demand because of miles driven in the US, especially now with the summer. We have been seeing good blending in the US. I think that the price of ethanol is very competitive to encourage blending. And we have seen exports at levels that we never seen before, probably north of 1.7, maybe even 1.9 billion gallons per year. So I think that that was a very logical kind of when you see that the strong demand was very logical that prices will rebound. And again, we don't see any change for now. It will depend on how much the U.S. produces, of course, of ethanol. But at this point in time, margins are holding, and we think that it bodes well for a strong Q3. In terms of sweeteners and starches, that business continues to have very robust volumes and very good margins. If anything, you can see a little bit of a pullback of the energy complex, if you will. That bodes well for manufacturing costs because these are big facilities. They consume a lot of energy. So natural gas prices being close to $2 is a little bit of a tailwind for us.
