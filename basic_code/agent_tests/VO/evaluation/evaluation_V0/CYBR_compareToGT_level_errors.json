So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Josh, I wanted to start with you on the Americas performance. So appreciate you quantifying that headwind for us as it relates to the model transition that seems like it's more concentrated in the Americas. Very helpful. Josh, since I have you, any high-level modeling points or expectations you could point us to as it relates to the subscription revenue and subscription ARR mix between SaaS and on-prem? And to the extent the performance this quarter is changing your mix expectations specifically for that category. And that's it for me. Thank you.____",

And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine-month sales cycles, and we're excited about the, you know, kind of the record, continued record growth that we have in pipeline, and we'll be continuing to expand our sales teams globally. and going into each of the quarters through the second half of the year. They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year.",

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security.

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition?

It was important that you talked about the maintenance piece of the ARR as well because we do actually, and I called it out in my prepared remarks, that we will probably start to see the decline even on the maintenance ARR, but then the super growth rate on the subscription piece of the ARR. And, you know, the confidence, again, it's really coming from, first of all, the faster transition and also the SaaS-heavy side of the transition. And we're seeing Privileged Cloud really being a big piece of that. And we're also seeing Privileged Cloud also going even further up market. And we talked a little bit about our average deal sizes going up. as well, especially for new logos. And it's really tied to privileged cloud success, also further upmarket, and the value that our customers and the enterprises are seeing in the subscription packages and for the self-hosted as well. You know, I think that, you know, we feel confident about the ARR growth, you know, about overachieving. You know, we put out the number in our guidance, you know, that we feel comfortable given the information we have in front of us. You know, we had great execution in 2021, but, you know, for now the guide is the guide, but absolutely the demand environment is there for us to invest in.____",

The deals, first of all, to double down on that or come back to that, the deals that we saw happen in Q1, the other component parts still do sit in the back half of the year and actually are progressing really nicely. So we're really happy with that. I think what I would say as related to the second quarter here is the team did a better job of actually positioning the right deal up front for the customer based upon a better understanding of their budgets, based upon a better understanding of you know, what they needed to procure, and maybe weren't seeking out the supersized deal to begin with. And in that case, we didn't see as much downsizing, you know, at the end of the quarter. We actually just saw a strong performance, strong execution, and the ability to be able to, you know, kind of deliver against the close rates that we would expect.

Or is SaaS going to continue to be more of a, I guess, larger enterprise opportunity with the ability to drive easier and more cost-effective adoption?____ it's great to see the strong net new ARR growth as well as a large deal of momentum",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yes, Zach, and thanks for asking. I mean, you know, first of all, you know, obviously we we had a great first quarter on cash flow. It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow.",

But I guess any plans to... maybe evaluate, go to market, and do you see any impact on customer adoption for next-gen EDR or to customers?

    "quoted_compliment": "Thanks, Rob. So overall, we had a strong quarter, our ability to be able to continue to drive momentum in the market. You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. I want to ask on... net new subscription ARR, which was flat from a year-over-year perspective. And I wanted to ask a question, I guess, from the perspective of just security spending and environment overall.____",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer.",

And that's kind of generating the pipeline coverage and the demand generation that we're seeing for the course of the rest of the year. I think the other point is we're well positioned from a go-to-market team and engine. Matt just alluded to the fact about where we are on quota reps and quota carriers. And just pretty much everything that we see coming out of Q1, first of all coming out of Q4, and then what we saw in Q1, And what we're seeing in the pipeline going forward and the overall demand environment that we're getting from the customer base, we're confident on being able to raise the guidance across those metrics.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Josh, actually a question for you on the guidance. I actually thought the guidance raised was better than expected in light of what we're seeing, I think, in software. More broadly, I'm curious, you know, it's Q1.

    "quoted_compliment": "Sure. And I may take both just in the interest of time to move us along, but they're good questions. So on the first front when we when we look at the bookings performance in the quarter remember bookings has nothing to do with duration, so the duration we just wanted to be transparent was a bump up in the quarter it's about three and a half million of contribution around revenue. But it but it but it's not a contributing factor to the strength of our overall business, the strength of our overall business. is based upon continued growth across the entire portfolio. We continue to see AAR just grow really strongly for each piece of the platform. Now, I highlighted in the call kind of particular strength in the secrets management business, and I'm very excited by that because that, again, is showing our ability to compete effectively as a security sale in the machine identity space. So I would highlight that. I would also highlight, as we talked about earlier, our ability to be able to go back into the base and expand customers beyond PAM or securing IT into new areas like securing developers or our ability to be able to go compete effectively in the quarter around workforce and our differentiated workforce solution. So across the board, I can point to the entire portfolio, talk about strong bookings, and that kind of comes from that overall approach. Remind me again of the second question?",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Thanks. I have two questions. Maybe I'll show them all at once. First for you, Josh, on the bookings upside, Can you give us a little bit more color there on how much of that is duration, new customers, expansion activities stronger than you expected, the mix of products there, any color would be great. And Matt, going back to the point you mentioned to the question of EPM being complementary to EDR, it is complementary today, but clearly more and more of your portfolio right now is at the edge. I would think the browser, I would think about that as an edge product as well. And so as you're moving closer and closer to the edge, can your EPM product evolve into an EDR-like product and be competitive with an EDR solution?____",

First of all, in that, you're prepared and worked, you called out some nice wins. And I just wanted to double double click on those and try to understand that or I guess confirm with you that second quarter was really driven by a host of different deals versus one or two really oversized large ones. And then second question for me, both for Matt as well as for Josh, is just getting an mention that over 50 percent are landing with two or more solutions. So how should we think about growth in just core PAM versus the other areas in your in your portfolio? And additionally, to just touch on any type of NRA type of a metric. I know last time you spoke, I think it was still trending above one twenty five. So we could just kind of get an indication of where it is now. That'd be helpful.

I know this you and I've talked about this a lot in the past, but I'm just curious, are you seeing sort of any uptick in at least conversations around cyber insurance or demand? Because to Rob's point, having new logos grow year over year for the first time in a year and a half in this quarter in this IT spending environment is not only impressive, it's also very unique. Like you spoke about the origin of the strength of the CISOs. They've recognized they really need to protect identities in a more robust way. But what's the tactical catalyst to that happening other than some of the, I guess, breaches we've heard about out there? Is cyber insurance, because cyber insurance, to get cyber insurance at a decent price, you have to have PAM. And is that part of what's driving this sort of uniqueness?
