And so as the first quarter that is chewing on some old pipeline, you can say we have some old pipeline that we expected to continue to sell as perpetual, but very pleased with how the mix is. has outperformed and very pleased with how it's looking in the current full-year Q2 and full-year pipeline. So I would say no pushback, but actually better than expected transition and really the way we wanted to start this year.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So I'm just curious what kind of pushback you may have gotten.

So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter.",

Josh, since I have you, any high-level modeling points or expectations you could point us to as it relates to the subscription revenue and subscription ARR mix between SaaS and on-prem?

I think we've invested the last several quarters on really integrating it to create 1 plus 1 equals 11 with being part of connected into PAM and part of the identity security portfolio. And we've also invested in putting overlay sales effort there. So we are It's still early innings for adaptive standalone, but we're seeing it, and some of the examples I've given, really play well in the cross-sell, up-sell motion with existing customers, and also as a new landing front for us, as a tip of the spear, as Matt called it, in the investor day. And so it's an early, young speedboat within CyberArk, But it's really taking off well. And, Rob, you know, on the AAR growth question, you know, we're still very much looking at 30% growth for the year on AAR. And, you know, we started off nicely on the first quarter with 41%, 30-plus percent organically, and we see that continuing through the year. All right, thanks.",

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security.

So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals?

Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 VERSUS THE SCENARIO FROM Q2 A YEAR AGO. AND ALREADY Q2 A YEAR AGO, WE STARTED TO HAVE MORE SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS ON A NATURAL BASIS. SO THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, WE SEE A SLIGHT DECLINE IN THE HEADWIND, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE STILL SUPPORTING THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH. WITH REGARD TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON MOVING IN THE GOALPOSTS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE REAL PLEASED WHERE WE STARTED THE FIRST QUARTER BECAUSE IT REALLY SET US UP WELL FOR BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH FIRMLY THAT THE TRANSITION IS HAPPENING, THAT IT'S CERTAINLY HAPPENING DEFINITELY WITHIN OUR ORIGINAL GOALPOSTS OF 8 TO 10 QUARTERS. WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE UP A COUPLE PERCENTAGE POINTS IN Q1. WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO MOVE UP A COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS ALREADY FOR Q2 AND FOR THE YEAR. I THINK Q1 IS STILL ONE QUARTER OF WORK. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE HOW Q2 GOES AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO, I THINK, BASED OFF OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, REALLY REEVALUATE AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THE FULL TRANSITION PERIOD. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK IN ORDER TO BRING IT IN, WE'LL WANT TO SEE, YOU KNOW, WE'LL WANT TO SEE HOW MORE THAN JUST ONE QUARTER BEHAVES ON THE TRANSITION. BUT SO FAR, WE LIKE WHAT WE SEE.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. First off, Your contribution from subscription bookings, I think, was 20% in the year-ago quarter. It expanded to 51%. It seems like that's moving very quickly. What will it take for you to accelerate your timeline for reaching that 70% to 80%? I think you would. suggested it would be 8 to 10 quarters out. So what do you think the likelihood of that happening before the end of fiscal 22? And then secondly, I think you had indicated that your headwind projected for Q2 is about $9 million. I think it was $11 million in the March quarter here. Why will it be coming down in the June quarter from the March quarter? This concludes our question and answer session.

And I would say that from a close rate perspective, we could probably talk about record – record close rates in this quarter. And so more and more signs of return to normal.

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition?

It was important that you talked about the maintenance piece of the ARR as well because we do actually, and I called it out in my prepared remarks, that we will probably start to see the decline even on the maintenance ARR, but then the super growth rate on the subscription piece of the ARR. And, you know, the confidence, again, it's really coming from, first of all, the faster transition and also the SaaS-heavy side of the transition. And we're seeing Privileged Cloud really being a big piece of that. And we're also seeing Privileged Cloud also going even further up market. And we talked a little bit about our average deal sizes going up. as well, especially for new logos. And it's really tied to privileged cloud success, also further upmarket, and the value that our customers and the enterprises are seeing in the subscription packages and for the self-hosted as well. You know, I think that, you know, we feel confident about the ARR growth, you know, about overachieving. You know, we put out the number in our guidance, you know, that we feel comfortable given the information we have in front of us.

Any commentary on kind of the competitive environment and how your position has changed as the pan market moves to the cloud would be great. Yeah, absolutely. That's one of the most exciting elements for us is that we are the market leader no matter how you slice it in PAM and in Privileged Cloud. The solution basically has, you know, in past investments caught up and then went beyond what we offer on PRAM. So the customers can really get the full solution with Privileged Cloud and we're seeing great win rates. and the ability for the customer, like I said earlier, to get quick time to value and expand faster. So I don't know what pounds to give it there, but if we were to just slice it and say, hey, how's the leadership from a TAM perspective in SaaS where the clear market leader is there, just like we showed up on the Gardner Magic Water three years in a row. And in this space, we're seeing that the plan players have been continuously disrupted by PE and changing hands over the last couple of years and really didn't invest in R&D while SideRock has continued to invest in R&D and innovation. and continue to open up a strong gap. And then take it into the platform approach where we're approaching everything as a platform sale, and customers can see, well, we're starting with you with Perfect Cloud, but, wow, you can also secure me on the endpoint in secrets management or my workforce and vendors. And so that's really another great differentiator there for the SaaS function. Woody, I want to interject here and just call out a correction. We said earlier that the EPM was 20% of total ARR, and I want to make sure that it was clear that it was 20% of subscription ARR.____",

I think first and foremost is the increased demand environment and our increased leadership position based on merit, you know, having the better products that address all of the broad use cases and definitely privilege access management. and expanding to identity. I do agree that there's been more publicity to the space from that perspective with announcements of entry of very early products where we do not see those products in the field and customers have heard of those pre-announcements. And, you know, I don't know how much we factor that into the awareness, but the awareness is up across the board for identity security. And that may be probably some contributing factor, but the biggest thing are the demand drivers and, you know, all of these years of focusing on the customers and focusing on being a broad platform for identity is huge. you know, it's bearing fruit for us in a very strong competitive position, as strong as I can remember.

    "quoted_compliment": "Yes, Zach, and thanks for asking. I mean, you know, first of all, you know, obviously we we had a great first quarter on cash flow. It was based off of coming off of a really strong year, and particularly Q4, and a strong Q4, not just in new business, but as you started to point out, it also included a really nice renewal base from Q4, which is kind of what you started alluding to, which is kind of the beginning of the first glimpse of the power of this model after the transition, and now really starting to see kind of the last piece of the flywheel come into effect, which is around cash flow. And, of course, we're able to boost from the first quarter by having excellent collections as well, and early Q1 bookings, which also supports the cash, and still continuing to control our expenses, which you know we like to do. So, overall, it reports a stellar growth cash flow execution for the first quarter. And that really gives us the confidence as one, kind of the first part that I mentioned, that actually the renewal and the recurring revenue does create that flywheel for billings and collections, assuming that we continue to collect at the well-executed rate that we are, that we expect to do. And then, of course, our overall bullishness in the business for the rest of the year as we also raise all of our metrics, not just the cash flow. And so I think it's a complete story around cash flow.",

You know, you've heard me talk for quarters about the difference in conversation with the CISO, with the CIO, with the C-suite, and elevating the conversation up to this identity security story and really talking about how do we help them with their overall security posture and help enable them as they talk to their boards, to their auditors, And at the top of the list is identity security. So we continue to see that building. We continue to see that strong. And Q1 was just a continuation of what we've been able to see over the last couple quarters. As it relates to the Q1 performance itself, we were very happy with where we ended up and the overall performance. There was one element that actually occurred in the quarter where we had about 2 million or so of renewals that basically wasn't able to come in due to the holidays and other stuff and has closed since. And that would have made the net new AR look a little bit better. It then has demonstrated in our ability to be able to raise full year at a high level. So overall, I would tell you that Q1 was a strong quarter for us, and there's been no change in the environment that we've seen out there.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. So first and foremost, I mean, we have a great set of customers. You know, we have more than 8,000, 8,800 worldwide. These customers trust us from a security perspective. And so our ability to go back into that base to upsell them more PAM seats and then expand them into EPM, into workforce, into secrets, into our secure cloud access, it's an incredibly strong position that we find ourselves in. And our sales team does an excellent job of really monetizing that base and expanding our footprint. And so I think you heard that in our talk track as we talk about that healthy expansion ability that we have. And I think it comes back to an earlier question, which is, our clear differentiation is this spectrum of identities and customers are buying into the idea that it's not enough to just secure the most privileged IT users with PAM. They need to apply privilege controls across the entire spectrum of identities. So I think on the existing business and our ability to upsell and expand, it just continues to be strong. It's been strong, and we're excited to see where we take that for quarters to come. From a new business perspective, we look at it and kind of say, anytime we can get 200 new logos in the door in a non-Q4 quarter, we're pretty happy with that. That allows us to be able to start the process of turning them into these longer-term customers to expand across the multiple identity groups. And so we look at Q1, and we've always said that in this macro and this environment, new logo deals take a little bit longer. They take a little bit more work. We've gotten better and better at doing that. And we're really happy with our ability to be able to land those logos. And frankly, we're really happy about the pipeline on those new logos, the ones we just landed, and when they are anticipated to come back for an expansion deal, because then the flywheel is really kicking in, and it brings us back to the beginning of my answer.",

It looks like Venify is contributing about 160 million of ARR to the full year. I'm curious. You know, how quickly was Venify ARR growing, exiting kind of the Q3 quarter, and do you have a rough estimate of what that SAS mix was for Q3?",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. And I'll offer my congrats as well to both Josh and Erica. You know, I wanted to ask a little bit about your workforce business. It's impressive to see it pass the $100 million ARR mark this quarter. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more context about how quickly that's actually growing in the base and maybe, you know, what percentage of the base is actually leveraging workforce? Thanks, guys. Best of luck.____I wanted to ask a little bit about your workforce business. It's impressive to see it pass the $100 million ARR mark this quarter.",

I have been called Don before, but anyway, Mike, I don't mean to beat a dead horse on this, but really, I think I'm curious, like why Venify represents an incremental growth plan for you? Matt, you talked about the go-to-market push, and that makes some sense. And you talked about a bunch of things here, but we've heard about this for a while, and Benefi has been around for a while, and it was a good company, a decent company, but it never seemed to fulfill its promise, right? Machine identities always made sense, but they never fulfilled its promise. And I just wonder if we're getting... a little bit too far ahead of ourselves here. And you guys have executed really well, and that's part of it too, right? That's positive. But I don't know, if you could speak a little bit to that. I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere.",

I'm sure there's a question in there somewhere. That all makes sense. And you guys, like I said, have executed well. But I guess ARR was strong this quarter, my follow-up here. And it was in the range of what we thought you could do, and that's great. But just curious if you saw any influence on this last quarter due to the U.S. election, and if you did, how do you see this influencing business going forward, if at all? Great. Thank you and congrats to the team.____",
