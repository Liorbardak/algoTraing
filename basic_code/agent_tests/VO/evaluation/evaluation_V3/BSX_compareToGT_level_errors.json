Okay. And one follow-up, you know, in the supplemental presentation and the prepared commentary, you talked about being able to resume a normal pace of account openings for Lotus and restarting a lot of your clinical trial activities. So that also seems encouraging. And I guess I was just hoping to get some color on how you're able to do that with the COVID flare-ups because, you know, that does – kind of fly in the face of it, but it seems like you're optimistic you'll be returning to a more normal pace here. ____ ",

And that's before we even start to look at company fundamentals. So I guess one big picture question I'd ask you, Mike, is, you know, all that's making it kind of hard for investors to know how to think about modeling for, you know, the next 12 months.

I want to talk about the amazing results of Faribault that we just saw, and specifically how you're thinking about moving, I was really interested in one quote that you said, to exceed 40 to 60% of global AF procedures by 2026. Thank you.____amazing results of Faribault",

Obviously, I get PFA adding some efficiencies to the system overall, but for EPs, between Watchmen and everything, there's a tremendous call on people's time. Love it.

I had a question just on, maybe for Dan, on some of the dynamics in the gross margin line in the quarter. You mentioned FX being kind of one of the primary headwinds, but as you move into 25, maybe you can talk a little bit about you know, where the leverage in the model is. It's, you know, table gross margin and levering some of the operating investments that you're making, but maybe just some color on how you see that progressing at this point. Thanks.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Morning. Thanks for taking the question. And I'd much rather focus on all the positive things going on here, but I'm looking at the stock down now versus up prior to this avant-garde commentary. So, Dr. Stein, I'm not sure exactly what you can say, but is there any kind of safety signal that we should be aware of? And then if you can't comment on that, is there anything to think about in terms of this patient population really being the cause of the difference, maybe extra lesions that need to be created? um, higher risk, you know, benefit requirements because it's drug naive patients. Um, just anything along those lines that you can share, um, because I think folks are pretty nervous this morning just based on, uh, how important Ferrapulse is to the, to the business. Thanks.____",
