    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. We're not concerned at all about the cost cutting and its ability to impact our competitiveness. We actually think it's smart. It's the rational cuts and our employees support it. So we have reduced down some of the inventory builds because we don't want to stack up too much inventory, which makes sense from a cashflow perspective. But we're very mindful of the need for surge capacity. So we ensure that we have ample supply, which we're very comfortable with based on the tracking that we do and the agility of our operations team. So we're doing this with a mindset that we're going to have a stronger recovery as the months move on here in second quarter and third quarter. And we're highly comfortable with ample supply, which is the most important one. Secondly, many of the actions that we've taken, actually we've led in this area, has been to secure our very important sales team. So we won't give the details there. We've ensured certain levels of compensation for our sales teams, despite the significant sales misses that are occurring. So we feel like we've built strong loyalty and support from our sales team by taking those actions earlier than most. And also we have moved to a four-day work week. And the goal for that would be for it to be a second quarter impact only, but we'll see how that progresses as the recovery returns. And quite frankly, that's been met pretty well with our employee base. They're highly engaged, they're working very effectively from home. We're building new capabilities in digital and it's really a one-team approach. And also with the support of the CARES Act, some of those employees are also benefiting from some of the financial relief in certain states in that area. So actually we think all the actions are what smart companies would do. And if anything, I think it's built potentially greater loyalty amongst our employee base within changes we've made.",

You pulled the future product launch page. Hopefully it'll come back once you could get trials restarted. But how were you thinking internally about the delays to new product launches and something that was in the pipeline that had a trial involved with it?",

So that also seems encouraging.
