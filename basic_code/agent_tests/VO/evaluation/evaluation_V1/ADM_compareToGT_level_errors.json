You know, you made a note in your press release in your comments that you expect improved market conditions. I suspect in light of the detailed comments that you gave, you're referring to the Carbohydrate Solutions Group particularly. But I'd be curious what you're expecting on the ag services and oil seats. Is 2020 a number that you think is, you know, probable to be eclipsed for EBIT based on the market view that you have right now? Or how should we be thinking about that setup?",

    "quoted_compliment": "Adam, listen, we said it before, we feel very strongly about the future of our oilseeds business. You know, it's a business that was built traditionally in one leg, if you will, from the mill supporting all this, and we were always waiting for the old story. The old story, I mean, you can see it right now playing up. oil values that reach record levels, soft-seed margins that have been the best in the last eight years, if you will. So they are supporting very good soy crush margins and great soft-seed margins. We invested in this many years ago, remember, with all this switch capacity. We have about, you know, give or take 15% of our total crash capacity that can be switched from soybeans to soft seeds. That's an advantage for us. Now, all of a sudden, we are having this new demand that is coming because of all the sustainability trends that we discussed before. in the form of renewable green diesel. So it just comes to strengthen our belief into this business that is very strategic for us. And to be honest, very proud of the way the business is executing. These are not easy markets to navigate with a lot of volatility, with very big values, and they are having, you know, touch wood, an impeccable run, and they've done very well, given their sophistication and knowledge And to be honest, also the visibility that being a full value chain supplier and a global supplier gives us. So continue to work very close with our food and fuel customers and staying close to them to make sure we can read what's coming down the pipe. But again, Adam, very, very encouraged by all these developments and very happy for our strategic oil seed business.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, we've seen some softness in some of those segments. But I would say this is a little bit of a transition time. Nutrition goes through so many applications. Depending on the geography, food services in some parts are coming back, and in some other parts, that's still delayed. So I would say, in general, I'm very pleased, actually. Nutrition surpassed my own expectations this quarter by growing profitability by around 9% and revenue 5%. It was, you know, the demand recovery from COVID and the impact of that in different markets is very uneven around the world as the world is getting access to vaccination at different rates. So we are seeing that. So as I said, this was a quarter of, remember, investment in nutrition. So we were expecting results similar to last year. We end up delivering results that are 9%. better than last year, so very happy with it. We had some, you know, specific pockets of softness, maybe some, you know, chewing gum, you know, kind of softness, some softness in some places in animal nutrition, but overall very strong flavors, beverages, supplements, fibers, probiotics, specialty proteins. the main trends remain there.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, listen, we continue to see strong demand. I think that as some restaurants and some places are reopening, we started to see food services coming back a little bit. To be honest, we saw that across the company, not only in soybean oil. I would say March orders were significantly better than January and February orders. And I think we see that continuing in April. So, again, a need for recovery, but we can see that. I would say, of course, we know where green diesel customers are starting to show in demand, so we see that increased demand. So, in general, we see a strong demand. In terms of destruction of demand, we haven't seen that to any degree. Probably the only example I can pinpoint is Brazil with biodiesel that reduced from B13 to B10, that's probably the only thing you can say, you know, things have become expensive at least. And Brazil, as I made, as I mentioned in my onset remarks, Brazil is having a very difficult time with COVID. So I think the overall economy is suffering, and I think the government is trying to alleviate some, to alleviate a little bit the pressure on inflation there. But that's probably the only example I can pinpoint to at this point of demand destruction.",

So clearly you had some implications in the third quarter because of Hurricane Ida, and you expect some of those effects to reverse in coming quarters.

There was some reduction in exports in act services in the first quarter because of weather issues, and some of that has been moved into the second quarter. So we have a good book there. China has put some orders also for corn, Q2 and Q3. We expect fresh profits to continue to be very strong in the second quarter. refining margins also very good. So I would say demand has been domestically strong for soybean mill in North America and certainly a lot of demand around the world for that. So we continue to see crash very well supported by the oil and the mill. We continue to see demand for our exports in second quarter. the window of exports of North America, it will have expanded a little bit. And certainly, the refining materials, they maintain very strong margins. If you look at last year, we entered into Q1 with low margins, and we ended with strong margins. This year has been strong margins across the quarter, and we expect that to continue into the second one.",

So customers see prices relatively high right now. Those customers that are not covered, they feel like maybe the curve is showing them that they can get covered later at a cheaper rate than today. So I would say, in general, we have coverage for the next quarter. not for Q3 or Q4. But when we look at the demand that we're seeing around the world, we think that when you think about milk and oil in general, not only North America, but also Brazil, the crush margins need to be there to encourage the crushers to crush. We need the demand for oil and we need the soybean milk. So you will have to have the demand the crash margins to incentivize people to crash. And we are seeing that with the margins that are happening in Brazil or the U.S. or Europe. All our margins today are higher than what we anticipated. And we think that as the year rolls out and demand continues to be solid out there and strong, crash margins will continue to send that signal to all of us crashers, which is we need the meal, we need the oil, keep crashing.",

So congrats. You know, listening to the call today, you know, Juan, I hear, as all of us, there's a lot of confusion, there's a lot of moving parts. So when I look back 10 weeks ago, I realized that U.S. grain prices had to move higher in order to even kind of even begin to maybe ration demand or not. And of course, they've moved quite a bit higher. So what I'd really like you to do, Juan, is kind of take a 30,000 foot viewpoint here. As we all know, price does ultimately ration demand. And the only thing I can see that would maybe do that at this point is maybe, you know, global recession or U.S. recession. So can you kind of, I don't see a lot of demand destruction at this point. A little bit from bird flu, maybe it's 25 million bushels, which is a spit in the ocean, but do you see any significant demand destruction today, including what's happening in Ukraine and what they have in storage for corn and other things? How do you look at the world today from a demand, total demand perspective versus supply, and are we seeing demand destruction with high prices?",

The teams continue to manage exceptionally well, and demand continues to be very robust. So as we go forward, Q4, again, in ag services, I was mentioning maybe a little bit lower for North American exports, but that will be upset for other things that I explained in the question before. So we still expect significantly better results in the Q4. Barring any big market-to-market, that's our expectation at this point in time. Crash margins continue to strengthen. That's on the strength of feeding animals around the world. but also on the extra demand for oil from all the renewable green diesel or biodiesel around the world. We expect continuous strength in global trade and destination marketing, as I explained before. I would say the business at this point in time is hitting in all cylinders. So I would say the three parts of the business will be robust into bigger than last year certainly. Maybe Vikram can give a little bit of an update on the other two.",

Traditionally, our Q3s have lower volumes because, you know, we are getting out of the end of the season and waiting for the next harvest. What happened this time is I think given the short South American crop, we've been able to move more volumes, especially exports in North America. Exports were down Q3 to Q2, but not down as much as maybe you've seen other years. The same has been a little bit for origination volumes. And when exports go, you know, we have benefits in our transportation businesses, you know, our barges and all that. Also, do not forget it's not just North America, but it's also the global nature. The global trades have done, you know, spectacular performance, and I think we have benefits in ocean freight. It was a very good quarter from that perspective. And also destination marketing. Destination marketing that we started, you know, four or five years ago, I don't remember exactly, has continued to grow volumes and expanded margins. So that, I would say, is what created these great tech services Q3. So great performance by the team.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Well, so on the crush margins, as Juan noted, Clearly, as you can also see in the curve right now, Q2 looks soft. And the reason is because of the expectation of certain delay in renewable green diesel capacity. Just to be clear, we remain confident that renewable green diesel capacity is going to increase by about a billion gallons in 2023. The timeline has just been pushed back to the second half of this year. So therefore, you see a little bit of softness in the nearby as a consequence of that. The other aspect is also related to what's happening in Argentina. In Argentina, there's more beans given what's happened with the soy dollar for at least part of Q2. There's more crush capacity, if you may, that's coming online. And that's also helping reduce a little bit of the nearby crush. What's going to happen in Argentina by May or June timeframe, they're going to run out of beans. So that export is not going to be available. So that should be supportive of crush margins. beyond Q2 and that's why you see the slight inverse in the curve in the nearby and then recovering in the back half of the year. So that's really all that happened. It was transitory, nothing that is more than that is the delay in renewable green diesel capacity as well as what's happening in Argentina. Thank you.",

But two, when you think about allocating capital at this point in the cycle, how does that change, if at all, with what you've been doing over the last several years?

And they've done a fantastic job of transforming their business into a very resilient and stable business. The assets, let me take it by pieces. The milling business, milling is an old business that has some old assets. And over the last few years, the team has been doing a terrific job of shutting down some assets and consolidating those in new facilities like Mendota that we launched last year that is the best and the newest wet mill implant in the world. So we are happy with the way they have done that. They continue to do so. So that business is in good shape. When we look at the wet mills, we continue to invest in part of the wet mills. It's unlikely that we're going to build a new wet mill, as you can understand. But that business continues to be reinvested in. It's a business that is a large business, has a large asset footprint. And at the moment, there is a lot of capital being associated with the path to decarbonize all these assets. So as you heard, we have a lot of efforts in trying to get pipelines to try to monetize um some of our uh co2 that come from uh the biogenic co2 that come from the ethanol plants so um and and i would say uh we have expanded marshall because biosolutions is growing at uh you know north of 15 per year so we needed capacity so the martial expansion is about the 50 expansion to to the to the final start capacity that we have there. And that will help a lot with that. I would say the year is exciting as it is developing. It has solid margins. It has so far solid volumes. It had a little bit of a rough January because of the bad weather. We have ice in the plants and freezing weather. But February, March, things look good. And we think that that business has the opportunity to get some tailwinds from lower energy costs and maybe chemicals cost as the year goes by. And that's a big energy hog, that business.
