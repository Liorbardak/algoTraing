    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, absolutely. We're not concerned at all about the cost cutting and its ability to impact our competitiveness. We actually think it's smart. It's the rational cuts and our employees support it. So we have reduced down some of the inventory builds because we don't want to stack up too much inventory, which makes sense from a cashflow perspective. But we're very mindful of the need for surge capacity. So we ensure that we have ample supply, which we're very comfortable with based on the tracking that we do and the agility of our operations team. So we're doing this with a mindset that we're going to have a stronger recovery as the months move on here in second quarter and third quarter. And we're highly comfortable with ample supply, which is the most important one. Secondly, many of the actions that we've taken, actually we've led in this area, has been to secure our very important sales team. So we won't give the details there. We've ensured certain levels of compensation for our sales teams, despite the significant sales misses that are occurring. So we feel like we've built strong loyalty and support from our sales team by taking those actions earlier than most. And also we have moved to a four-day work week. And the goal for that would be for it to be a second quarter impact only, but we'll see how that progresses as the recovery returns. And quite frankly, that's been met pretty well with our employee base. They're highly engaged, they're working very effectively from home. We're building new capabilities in digital and it's really a one-team approach. And also with the support of the CARES Act, some of those employees are also benefiting from some of the financial relief in certain states in that area. So actually we think all the actions are what smart companies would do. And if anything, I think it's built potentially greater loyalty amongst our employee base within changes we've made.",

    "quoted_compliment": "Sure. Just broadly, all of them have improved each month. April, May, June, some of the businesses were down farther in April and faster back in June, like Neuromod. But we're encouraged by the overall IC improvement trend, April, May, June, and consistent with all our businesses, nice improvement in July. Within Structural Heart, we didn't break out each month within the product categories, but Watchman did have a larger impact in the trough in April. But we've seen a very nice consistent recovery, as I mentioned in the script, throughout the second quarter. and also a very nice improvement in July. So really encouraged about the watchman momentum that we're seeing. And as I mentioned before, the TAVR new openings were impacted more significantly in the second quarter. So we are starting to see the gates open up a bit more in terms of new account openings with Lotus, and we're going to be launching the Accurate Neo2 device in Europe in the second half. So we have seen improvement. Again, our structural heart portfolio, particularly in June and July from second quarter. On the portfolio side, we've got some important launches, obviously, with Accurate NEO2 scheduled to launch in Europe in the second half. We're excited about that. Sentinel continues to perform very well. And we continue to enroll in the U.S. on our intermediate risk trial with Lotus, as well as our U.S. trial with AccurateNeo2. But obviously the most exciting thing for us is the next generation Watchman device, which recently was approved. It has excellent clinical data. It was our fastest enrolling trial that we've ever had as a company. And we'll begin our LME, our initial launch, very quickly here. We expect to go to a full launch mode in fourth quarter. So kudos to the team for excellent engineering with that. Our clinical team did a great job on the trial, and we're very bullish on the future of our Watchman franchise with a second generation, which we expect to be in the market likely a year or potentially more prior to the next generation competitor coming.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Great. Thanks for taking the question. I'll ask both of mine together as it's a bit longer. But, you know, looking at core IC and structural heart along with EP and CRM, there was a bit less of a recovery from April to June. and some of those, particularly structural heart, have some of your most important growth products going forward. I was hoping you could just talk about the current dynamics there, what that's looking like going forward. Should we expect a faster recovery? A lot of these patients can't be put off forever, as you mentioned a couple times. How should we think about those going forward, and should we see that trend catch up to some of the other performance metrics? And then, Just spend a minute on what you're seeing in the structural heart, new product launches, particularly TAVR and Watchmen, and how we should expect those trends to improve going forward.

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, so if you think about that, you take a step back and look at third quarter, and that's why I started my script that I'm really proud of the team's global execution. Because if you think about it, we went through a delta surge in the third quarter, which was bigger than most anybody anticipated. And we grew 11% versus 20% and 4% versus 19%. Now, 4% is not a great number, but it's not a bad number, growing 4% given the delta surge. And during that time, we had nice improvement in operating income margin, despite some of the supply chain headwinds that everyone's familiar with. And we delivered our EPS growth. So in a quarter where Delta surged, we grew top line fairly well, clearly not where we want it to be in normal situations, but we improved margins. We hit EPS. And in the third quarter, we have all those macro issues you talked about, but we do anticipate moving forward that You know, the impact on COVID in the company when it surges has decreased upon each surge. So every time there's been a Delta surge, the performance, although not where we want it to be, has been better each time. And so that shows the hospital's ability to manage COVID. You know, one great thing about our portfolio was we're primarily an interventional medicine company. And I was at a couple sites just yesterday, and they're doing 80% of their Watchman volume outpatient now. So you've seen a dramatic shift in Watchman, for example, outpatient procedures. So I think our portfolio has tailwinds that support productivity for hospitals. Hospitals have shown the ability to execute despite surges. And in a quarter where about every macro issue was thrown on top of the company, I think the performance is quite good.",

I made a few comments before that, first of all, Watchman, the clinical results for Watchman Flex are extraordinarily good. And doctors have tremendous confidence in the platform, and they've been using it for about a year. And your average doctor is increasing their utilization of Watchmen every quarter because of the confidence that they have. And the referring physician community is seeing their patients recover and get off blood thinners and reduce the risk of stroke. So it's expanding the awareness in the referring physician community, the GI community, the neuro community. So there's a lot of momentum there. And the other important thing I mentioned, that productivity, even in COVID, You have hospitals dramatically moving watchmen, limiting anesthesia, using ice imaging, and doing procedures that are very, very efficient, in many cases less than an hour. And the economics of watchmen now are quite good across the U.S. So there's, you know, there's always headwinds and tailwinds across a diversified portfolio, but the tailwinds from reimbursement, procedural efficiency, Clinical outcomes, new clinical data, product cadence are very, very positive with Watchman.",

Mike, on Watchman, we understand the market is underpenetrated and should expand massively given the amount of clinical data. But in the context of staffing challenges, you know, uh, code and my understanding is there are limited number of centers who can do these kinds of structural hard procedures. Um, you know, how should we think about market expansion versus, uh, uh, you know, is that going to accelerate in the, in this current environment, uh, given the challenges and you have a second player coming in, uh, would love your thoughts on, uh, on market expansion versus, uh, uh, competition and on, on tax, uh, Dan, Is the call for tax reform, what kind of impact should we assume?

    "quoted_compliment": "Sure. I've been in the field a lot recently, and it is an issue for hospital CEOs. There's no doubt about it. They've had to increase their wages and labor force expenses to accommodate increasing wages for nurses and staff and so forth. So they're working through that process. But it's not going to be a short-term issue, but hospitals are pretty resilient. And as you know, a couple things I would say that point specific to BSE and how that's changing is just the use of telehealth and telemedicine and prescreening for patients has become, you know, very widespread and very efficient. So that reduces down significantly the number of patient visits to the hospital, drives more efficiency and staff productivity. So I think you're going to continue to see that trend, you know, continue to increase. Another one more specific to Boston is what I mentioned before is, you know, we're not a surgery company. So we're not driving multi-day length of stays in a hospital. The portfolio shift, the shift to interventional medicine is helpful for hospitals. And it gets patients in and out of the clinic or outpatient setting typically in the same day. And you see more of our complex procedures because of the capabilities and the technology we have augmented by imaging move to more outpatient settings. And I made the comment on Watchmen how that mix shift has moved more and more to same-day procedures. So I think a combination of telehealth, a combination of outpatient orientation and same-day procedures is very helpful for our product mix. And hospitals, just like anybody else, they innovate and they find a way. So it is a headwind. But it's, you know, in the quarter here where we had staffing shortages and its surge, we grew okay. And I think the surges will calm and the staffing shortage will likely linger a bit. But hospitals are pretty resilient in figuring out ways to drive volume.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question. Mike, I appreciate all the commentary on COVID and improving, and I think we're all in the same boat. We hope it's better heading into next year. But just the new dynamic here is the hospital labor shortage, and I'm just curious sort of how you as a company are helping hospitals manage through that, what you're seeing hospitals do to adapt to be able to continue to get patients through the system and treated, given the labor shortages, which, you know, that to me seems like a tougher nut to crack as far as like sort of when that will resolve.

And the TheraSphere platform continues to do extremely well. And you saw that clinical data. So, you know, that division continues to do very well. Endo, I would put him despite COVID, grew 8% versus 19 in the quarter. And a number of new product launches. Euro has been impacted by COVID, but That typically bounces back when COVID improves.

We continue to lag in the U.S., but the EP momentum we see in Europe and Japan is very encouraging based on our cryo capabilities as well as the early insights into FerriPulse.

So if you look at cardiology and you look at peripheral, you look at cardiac rhythm management, those have held on and we're actually getting pretty good at this now at the number of waves we've had relative to COVID. Those are much more emergent and hold up better. Mike mentioned this earlier that businesses like neuromodulation and urology, they come down very quickly in a COVID wave. The good news is they come back very quickly. So it's kind of a V-shaped curve for those businesses. They obviously don't perform as well in a COVID setting, but they come back very nicely on the other side. So there's not really one number you can point to for the whole company and pinpoint it. It varies by business. But I think we've proven and have a good track record in a non-COVID environment that the business performs very well.
