So actually, when we looked at it and you touched it, we're actually excited to see that it's the faster mover in the transition with the heaviest weight on SAS. I would say some specific elements of this quarter. I mean, Americas is coming off a record 32% growth Q4, and it was the fastest of the region. And so we're pleased with where we are in the Americas, especially when we see the great pipe, the great start of Q2, and are optimistic for the rest of the year. And I guess I would add there, I would just add on a specific in terms of markets, you know, last year in the first quarter, we had a very strong federal spend that was out of cycle. And, you know, that didn't repeat in this quarter.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Josh, I wanted to start with you on the Americas performance. So appreciate you quantifying that headwind for us as it relates to the model transition that seems like it's more concentrated in the Americas. Very helpful. Josh, since I have you, any high-level modeling points or expectations you could point us to as it relates to the subscription revenue and subscription ARR mix between SaaS and on-prem? And to the extent the performance this quarter is changing your mix expectations specifically for that category. And that's it for me. Thank you.____",

And, you know, we have, you know, still six to nine-month sales cycles, and we're excited about the, you know, kind of the record, continued record growth that we have in pipeline, and we'll be continuing to expand our sales teams globally. and going into each of the quarters through the second half of the year. They do take two to three quarters to ramp, so we always anticipate future growth by bringing them on board earlier. And I would say that when we look at the big hirings that we did in H2 of last year, In Q3, Q4, and certainly the ones for the first half of last year, we already are seeing them really fully productive at this point. And we actually saw a nice increase in productivity into this first quarter from our sales teams, and I think it has to do with the ramp-up that we did last year on the sales teams. And I would add that, like I mentioned in my notes, they're really on board with the SAS subscription. I mean, almost all of the reps have subscription deals in their pipe. Some have only subscription deals in their pipe, and that's why I noted that we're very pleased with how we kicked it off from the beginning of the year.",

I think the commentary last year or earlier in the year, we talked about the customer kind of looking to do the basics as they transition to work from home. And now we're seeing them be much more back to their strategic programs. We already saw that in Q4 and it competed in that. in Q1 and commentary and things we're seeing in deal cycles, both related to SolarWinds and also related to being back on track, is that they're looking to do deeper programs, whether like in the commentary, really following our blueprint when it comes to add-on and looking at multiple products and solutions, but also in new customers. We're seeing them be more strategic in about going deep in PAM and other areas in identity security. I would say that the average deal size is up and SAS deal size are similar to historic perpetual deal size, which is great.",

I would say we still talk about a six- to nine-month sales cycle, but beginning to see the advantages and value, like you're talking about, of customers, of higher velocity sales, when it comes to SaaS customers and their ability to get a faster time to value and then faster adoption and our ability to push across. So faster, we're not changing our kind of our six to nine month general approach, but we are very optimistic that this is one of the upsides of this transition. And I would add that, you know, we're seeing much better close rates going into the first quarter of this year. So that – Udi mentioned it before, and I'll mention it again. And when we think about the record pipeline, I would also say what we like about it is that it's – First of all, going across all aspects of the pipeline, new customers, existing customers, across each of the geographies and across each of the product lines that we're talking about, whether it's privilege, access, or DevSecOps. And, of course, one of the other things that we're tracking very closely is, is it supporting our transition goals?

    "quoted_compliment": "Yeah, thanks, Eric, for those questions. I'll start with the second one. Basically, as we moved last year, if you think about it on a year-on-year basis, we already started to see some increases last year between Q1 and Q2 on the percent subscription. YOU KNOW, THAT'S IMPACTING THE MATH. YOU KNOW, WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, WE LOOK AT IT YEAR ON YEAR. SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT FROM A CUMULATIVE PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE LOOKING AT IT AS, OKAY, WE'RE TAKING THIS YEAR'S Q2 versus the scenario FROM Q2 a year ago. And already Q2 a year ago, we started to have more subscription business on a natural basis. So that's why, you know, we see a slight decline in the headwind, but, you know, we're still supporting the strong revenue growth. With regard to your first question on moving in the goalposts, You know, we're real pleased where we started the first quarter because it really set us up well for being able to establish firmly that the transition is happening, that it's certainly happening definitely within our original goalposts of 8 to 10 quarters. We're able to move up a couple percentage points in Q1. We also were able to move up a couple of percentage points already for Q2 and for the year. I think Q1 is still one quarter of work. But, you know, we'll see how Q2 goes and we'll be able to, I think, based off of the first half of the year, really reevaluate again, you know, the full transition period. But, you know, I think in order to bring it in, we'll want to see, you know, we'll want to see how more than just one quarter behaves on the transition. But so far, we like what we see.",
    "quoted_compliment_GT": "Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. First off, Your contribution from subscription bookings, I think, was 20% in the year-ago quarter. It expanded to 51%. It seems like that's moving very quickly. What will it take for you to accelerate your timeline for reaching that 70% to 80%? I think you would. suggested it would be 8 to 10 quarters out. So what do you think the likelihood of that happening before the end of fiscal 22? And then secondly, I think you had indicated that your headwind projected for Q2 is about $9 million. I think it was $11 million in the March quarter here. Why will it be coming down in the June quarter from the March quarter? This concludes our question and answer session.

So, Josh, for you, Ruby obviously did a great job highlighting a lot of the Go drivers for 2022. If I look at your ARR guide, and I assume, you know, maintenance, let's assume it just stays flat, you're guiding for about a 30% growth in net new subs ARR. after what was a really strong acceleration in 21. So I'm curious, how much of that is attributed to this demand inflection that you've spoken so clearly about in the back half of last year versus a faster transition? And to put it bluntly, do you feel like you've given yourself enough wiggle room to really outperform like you did last year?",

It was important that you talked about the maintenance piece of the ARR as well because we do actually, and I called it out in my prepared remarks, that we will probably start to see the decline even on the maintenance ARR, but then the super growth rate on the subscription piece of the ARR. And, you know, the confidence, again, it's really coming from, first of all, the faster transition and also the SaaS-heavy side of the transition. And we're seeing Privileged Cloud really being a big piece of that. And we're also seeing Privileged Cloud also going even further up market. And we talked a little bit about our average deal sizes going up. as well, especially for new logos. And it's really tied to privileged cloud success, also further upmarket, and the value that our customers and the enterprises are seeing in the subscription packages and for the self-hosted as well. You know, I think that, you know, we feel confident about the ARR growth, you know, about overachieving. You know, we put out the number in our guidance, you know, that we feel comfortable given the information we have in front of us. You know, we had great execution in 2021, but, you know, for now the guide is the guide, but absolutely the demand environment is there for us to invest in.____",

Is this going to be multiple years of elevated investments, or is it more of an initial investment followed by margin improvement as your volume goes up?

Any commentary on kind of the competitive environment and how your position has changed as the pan market moves to the cloud would be great. Yeah, absolutely. That's one of the most exciting elements for us is that we are the market leader no matter how you slice it in PAM and in Privileged Cloud. The solution basically has, you know, in past investments caught up and then went beyond what we offer on PRAM. So the customers can really get the full solution with Privileged Cloud and we're seeing great win rates. and the ability for the customer, like I said earlier, to get quick time to value and expand faster. So I don't know what pounds to give it there, but if we were to just slice it and say, hey, how's the leadership from a TAM perspective in SaaS where the clear market leader is there, just like we showed up on the Gardner Magic Water three years in a row. And in this space, we're seeing that the plan players have been continuously disrupted by PE and changing hands over the last couple of years and really didn't invest in R&D while SideRock has continued to invest in R&D and innovation. and continue to open up a strong gap. And then take it into the platform approach where we're approaching everything as a platform sale, and customers can see, well, we're starting with you with Perfect Cloud, but, wow, you can also secure me on the endpoint in secrets management or my workforce and vendors. And so that's really another great differentiator there for the SaaS function. Woody, I want to interject here and just call out a correction. We said earlier that the EPM was 20% of total ARR, and I want to make sure that it was clear that it was 20% of subscription ARR.____",

I think first and foremost is the increased demand environment and our increased leadership position based on merit, you know, having the better products that address all of the broad use cases and definitely privilege access management. and expanding to identity. I do agree that there's been more publicity to the space from that perspective with announcements of entry of very early products where we do not see those products in the field and customers have heard of those pre-announcements. And, you know, I don't know how much we factor that into the awareness, but the awareness is up across the board for identity security. And that may be probably some contributing factor, but the biggest thing are the demand drivers and, you know, all of these years of focusing on the customers and focusing on being a broad platform for identity is huge. you know, it's bearing fruit for us in a very strong competitive position, as strong as I can remember.
